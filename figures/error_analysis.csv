"Abstract Experimental tests of community assembly mechanisms for host‐associated microbiomes in nature are lacking. Asymptomatic foliar fungal endophytes are a major component of the plant microbiome and are increasingly recognized for their impacts on plant performance, including pathogen defense, hormonal manipulation, and drought tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether fungal endophytes preferentially colonize certain host ecotypes or genotypes, reflecting some degree of biotic adaptation in the symbioses, or whether colonization is simply a function of spore type and abundance within the local environment. Whether host ecotype, local environment, or some combination of both controls the pattern of microbiome formation across hosts represents a new dimension to the age‐old debate of nature versus nurture. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant design to explore the extent of host specificity and biotic adaptation in the plant microbiome, as evidenced by differential colonization of host genetic types by endophytes. Specifically, replicate plants from three locally‐adapted ecotypes of the native grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were transplanted at three geographically distinct field sites (one home and two away) in the Midwestern US . At the end of the growing season, plant leaves were harvested and the fungal microbiome characterized using culture‐dependent sequencing techniques. Our results demonstrated that fungal endophyte community structure was determined by local environment (i.e., site), but not by host ecotype. Fungal richness and diversity also strongly differed by site, with lower fungal diversity at a riparian field site, whereas host ecotype had no effect. By contrast, there were significant differences in plant phenotypes across all ecotypes and sites, indicating ecotypic differentiation of host phenotype. Overall, our results indicate that environmental factors are the primary drivers of community structure in the switchgrass fungal microbiome.",0,1,0.3464521169662475,0.6535479426383972,3,bert-base-uncased,True,4

"Microbial symbionts inhabit tissues of all plants and animals. Their community composition depends largely on two ecological processes: (1) filtering by abiotic conditions and host species determining the environments that symbionts are able to colonize and (2) dispersal-limitation determining the pool of symbionts available to colonize a given host and community spatial structure. In plants, the above- and belowground tissues represent such distinct habitats for symbionts that we expect different effects of filtering and spatial structuring on their symbiont communities. In this study, we characterized above- and belowground communities of fungal endophytes—fungi living asymptomatically within plants—to understand the contributions of filtering and spatial structure to endophyte community composition. We used a culture-based approach to characterize endophytes growing in leaves and roots of three species of coastal beachgrasses in dunes of the USA Pacific Northwest. For leaves, endophyte isolation frequency and OTU richness depended primarily on plant host species. In comparison, for roots, both isolation frequency and OTU richness increased from the nutrient-poor front of the dune to the higher-nutrient backdune. Endophyte community composition in leaves exhibited a distance-decay relationship across the region. In a laboratory assay, faster growth rates and lower spore production were more often associated with leaf- than root-inhabiting endophytes. Overall, our results reveal a greater importance of biotic filtering by host species and dispersal-limitation over regional geographic distances for aboveground leaf endophyte communities and stronger effects of abiotic environmental filtering and locally patchy distributions for belowground root endophyte communities.",0,1,0.2567584812641144,0.7432414889335632,0,bert-base-uncased,True,4

"Abstract Microorganisms play a crucial role in the biological decomposition of plant litter in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the permanently changing litter quality during decomposition, studies of both fungi and bacteria at a fine taxonomic resolution are required during the whole process. Here we investigated microbial community succession in decomposing leaf litter of temperate beech forest using pyrotag sequencing of the bacterial 16S and the fungal internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) rRNA genes. Our results reveal that both communities underwent rapid changes. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated over the entire study period, but their taxonomic composition and abundances changed markedly among sampling dates. The fungal community also changed dynamically as decomposition progressed, with ascomycete fungi being increasingly replaced by basidiomycetes. We found a consistent and highly significant correlation between bacterial richness and fungal richness ( R = 0.76, P {<} 0.001) and community structure ( R M antel = 0.85, P {<} 0.001), providing evidence of coupled dynamics in the fungal and bacterial communities. A network analysis highlighted nonrandom co‐occurrences among bacterial and fungal taxa as well as a shift in the cross‐kingdom co‐occurrence pattern of their communities from the early to the later stages of decomposition. During this process, macronutrients, micronutrients, C:N ratio and pH were significantly correlated with the fungal and bacterial communities, while bacterial richness positively correlated with three hydrolytic enzymes important for C, N and P acquisition. Overall, we provide evidence that the complex litter decay is the result of a dynamic cross‐kingdom functional succession.",0,1,0.060689229518175125,0.9393107891082764,4,bert-base-cased,True,3

"Most Boletaceae form ectomycorrhizas but species in two sister groups (subfamily Chalciporoideae and the genus Pseudoboletus) have unclear trophic modes and are putatively mycoparasitic. Chalciporoideae is the earliest diverging lineage in Boletaceae and includes Chalciporus and Buchwaldoboletus. Buchwaldoboletus species fruit on wood and were thought to be saprobes, but the type species Buchwaldoboletus lignicola is mycoparasitic on the wood decay fungus Phaeolus schweinitzii. However, the nutritional mode and host range of B. lignicola and other Buchwaldoboletus remain unclear. We obtained fresh collections and axenic cultures of B. lignicola, B. hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus from the southeastern USA. We use cultures to examine the phylogenetic relationships among taxa in Chalciporoideae, elucidate the trophic mode of Buchwaldoboletus species and test the effect that Buchwaldoboletus species have on wood decay. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the Chalciporus lineage is sister to all other Boletaceae but suggests that Buchwaldoboletus is not monophyletic. Confrontation experiments on agar suggest that Buchwaldoboletus species might parasitize a wide range of decay fungi. Buchwaldoboletus hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus produce abundant conidia in culture whereas the more distantly related B. lignicola produces sclerotia. Wood decay assays show that Buchwaldoboletus species did not have a significant effect on the decay caused by wood decay fungi.

"ABSTRACT Cladobotryum dendroides (= Dactylium dendroides ) has hitherto been regarded as the major causal agent of cobweb disease of the cultivated mushroom, Agaricus bisporus . Nucleotide sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of four Cladobotryum/Hypomyces species reported to be associated with cobweb disease, however, indicate that the most common pathogen is now C. mycophilum . This cobweb pathogen varies somewhat in conidial septation from published descriptions of C. mycophilum and lacks the distinctive colony odor. ITS sequencing revealed minor nucleotide variation which split isolates of the pathogen into three subgroups, two comprising isolates that were sensitive to methylbenzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides and one comprising MBC-resistant isolates. The MBC-resistant isolates, which were only obtained from Ireland and Great Britain, clustered together strongly in randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis, suggesting that they may be clonal. The MBC-sensitive isolates were more diverse. A RAPD fragment of 800 to 900 bp, containing a microsatellite and found in the MBC-resistant isolates, also indicated their clonal nature; the microsatellites of these isolates contained the same number of GA repeats. Smaller, polymorphic microsatellites, similarly comprising GA repeats, in the MBC-sensitive isolates in general correlated with their geographic origin.",0,1,0.24216924607753754,0.757830798625946,2,biodivbert,True,1
"Activities of carboxylation enzymes were analyzed in the mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria (L. ex Fr.) Hooker, in non‐mycorrhizal short roots of Norway spruce ( Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and in myconhizas of these two partners. While pyruvale carboxylase (PC, EC 6.4.1.1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities (PEPCK.EC 4.1.1.49) could be detected in the mycelium of A. muscaria , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyknase (PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31) was only active in root tissue. In A. muscaria , PC activity was generally low (around 10 nmol mg −t protein min − ) but PEPCK activity was above 250 nmol mg −1 protein min −1 . Mycorrhizal development on short roots decreased PEPC activity by more than 75\%, although dilution by the fungal biomass in mycorrhizas was only 35\%. This reduction in activity was paralleled by a decreased content of PEPC protein. By means of micro‐analytical methods it was shown that PEPC activity was lowest in the central zones of the mycorrhizas, Whereas PEPC activity was highest in the corresponding central sections in non‐mycorrhizal short roots. 14 CO 2 labelling, on the other hand, revealed that in vivo CO 2 fixation was higher in mycorrhizas compared to non‐mycorrhizal short roots. It is concluded that fungal carboxylases (probably PEPCK) are important for anaplerotic CO 2 fixation during nitrogen assimilation in mycorrhizas of Norway spruce.",0,1,0.06442909687757492,0.9355708360671997,1,bert-base-cased,True,1
"Although Nectria is the type genus of Nectriaceae (Hypocreales, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota), the systematics of the teleomorphic and anamorphic state of Nectria sensu Rossman has not been studied in detail. The objectives of this study are to 1) provide a phylogenetic overview to determine if species of Nectria with Gyrostroma, Tubercularia, and Zythiostroma anamorphs form a monophyletic group; 2) define Nectria, segregate genera, and their species using morphologically informative characters of teleomorphic and anamorphic states; and 3) provide descriptions and illustrations of these genera and species. To accomplish these objectives, results of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from six loci (act, ITS, LSU, rpb1, tef1 and tub), were integrated with morphological characterisations of anamorphs and teleomorphs. Results from the phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that species previously regarded as the genus Nectria having Gyrostroma, Tubercularia, and Zythiostroma anamorphs belong in two major paraphyletic clades. The first major clade regarded as the genus Pleonectria contains 26 species with ascoconidia produced by ascospores in asci, perithecial walls having bright yellow scurf, and immersed or superficial pycnidial anamorphs (Zythiostroma = Gyrostroma). A lineage basal to the Pleonectria clade includes Nectria miltina having very small, aseptate ascospores, and trichoderma-like conidiophores and occurring on monocotyledonous plants. These characteristics are unusual in Pleonectria, thus we recognise the monotypic genus Allantonectria with Allantonectria miltina. The second major clade comprises the genus Nectria sensu stricto including the type species, N. cinnabarina, and 28 additional species. Within the genus Nectria, four subclades exist. One subclade includes species with sporodochial anamorphs and another with synnematous anamorphs. The other two paraphyletic subclades include species that produce abundant stromata in which the large perithecia are immersed, large ascospores, and peculiar anamorphs that form pycnidia or sporodochia either on their natural substrate or in culture. In this study the evolution of species, morphology, and ecology of the three genera, Allantonectria, Nectria, and Pleonectria, are discussed based on the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, descriptions, illustrations, and keys for identification are presented for the 56 species in Allantonectria, Nectria, and Pleonectria.",0,1,0.3977315127849579,0.6022685170173645,0,biodivbert,True,1
"Arbutoid mycorrhizal plants are commonly found as understory vegetation in forests worldwide where ectomycorrhiza-forming trees occur. Comarostaphylis arbutoides (Ericaceae) is a tropical woody plant and common in tropical Central America. This plant forms arbutoid mycorrhiza, whereas only associations with Leccinum monticola as well as Sebacina sp. are described so far. We collected arbutoid mycorrhizas of C. arbutoides from the Cerro de la Muerte (Cordillera de Talamanca), Costa Rica, where this plant species grows together with Quercus costaricensis. We provide here the first evidence of mycorrhizal status for the Ascomycete Leotia cf. lubrica (Helotiales) that was so far under discussion as saprophyte or mycorrhizal. This fungus formed arbutoid mycorrhiza with C. arbutoides. The morphotype was described morphologically and anatomically. Leotia cf. lubrica was identified using molecular methods, such as sequencing the internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) and the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA regions, as well as phylogenetic analyses.

"Candida spp. are part of the normal vaginal microﬂora in 20e30\% of healthy women. However, if the balance between these yeasts and the host is disturbed, Candida spp. can cause vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), with Candida albicans being the major causative agent. Different studies have been performed in order to better understand Candida's dual lifestyle in the vagina. The potential of C. albicans to switch from the yeast cell morphology to its hyphal form is considered a key element in VVC pathogenesis. Candida spp. also express other virulence factors, such as hydrolytic extracellular enzymes and heat shock proteins and can form bioﬁlms.",1,0,0.5782303810119629,0.4217695891857147,4,bert-base-uncased,True,1
"Ectomycorrhizal fungi are crucial for forests sustainability. For Castanea sativa, ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius is an important mutualist partner. Saprotrophic fungi Hypholoma fasciculare, although used for biocontrol of Armillaria root disease, it negatively affected the interaction between the P. tinctorius and plant host roots, by compromise the formation of P. tinctorius-C. sativa mycorrhizae. In this work, fungal morphology during inhibition of H. fasciculare against P. tinctorius was elucidated. P. tinctorius growth was strongly affected by H. fasciculare, which was significantly reduced after six days of co-culture and become even more significant through time. During this period, P. tinctorius developed vesicles and calcium oxalate crystals, which were described as mechanisms to stress adaption by fungi. H. fasciculare produced different volatile organic compounds in co-cultures over time and differ between single or in dualspecies. H. fasciculare highly produced sesquiterpenes (namely, α-muurolene) and nitrogencontaining compounds, which are recognised as having antimicrobial activity.",0,1,0.17489376664161682,0.8251062631607056,0,biodivbert,True,1

"Extremely acidic soils (pH{<}3) harbour poorly diversified mycobiota that are very different from less acidic habitats. During investigations of the mycobiota from several highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic and a coastal site in the Antarctic Peninsula, a group of hyaline fungal isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates belonged to three phylogenetic lineages within two different classes, Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes (Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). The first lineage is described here as a new genus and species Acidothrix acidophila gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Amplistromataceae, Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota). The most closely related species to this new clade are woodinhabiting fungi. The isolates belonging to the second and the third lineages are also described as two new genera and species Acidea extrema gen. nov. et sp. nov. and Soosiella minima gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Helotiales, Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota). Their position and the relationships within Helotiales are discussed. Soosiella minima was acidotolerant, Acidothrix acidophila and Acidea extrema exhibited both acidotolerant and acidophilic characteristics. All the species were slightly halophilic.

"Filamentous ascomycete Phomopsis sp. are common inhabitants of natural ecosystems and, as saprophytes, are largely responsible for the destructive decay of litterfall, promoting the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Phomopsis liquidambari B3 can establish mutualistic symbiosis with a broad spectrum of crop plants. Colonizing dynamics observations and a growth promotion assay of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the B3 colonization strategy is host-adapted and resulted in diﬀerent growth promotions inﬂuenced by N availability. However, the biochemical mechanisms and underlying genetics of the saprophyte transition to an endophyte are poorly understood. Here, the transcriptome features of generalist P. liquidambari and highlighted gene sets involved in the lifestyle transition from saprophytism to endophytism were reported. Most notable were genes for translation, ribosome biogenesis and MAPK signaling, several of which were only up-regulated in endophytic B3. Coordinated up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were preceded by secondary metabolite induction, which was encountered with host defense. Quantitative PCR validates the reliability of RNA-seq. Dissection at the molecular level facilitated a deeper understanding of P. liquidambari adaptation to hosts and the complex natural environment to play a role in sustainable agriculture and carbon and nitrogen cycles.",1,0,0.574303150177002,0.4256968796253204,4,bert-base-uncased,True,1
"Premise of the Study The Hymenochaetales are dominated by lignicolous saprotrophic fungi involved in wood decay. However, the group also includes bryophilous and terricolous taxa, but their modes of nutrition are not clear. Here, we investigate patterns of carbon and nitrogen utilization in numerous non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales and provide a phylogenetic context in which these non‐canonical ecological guilds arose. Methods We combined stable isotope analyses of δ 13 C and δ 15 N and phylogenetic analyses to explore assignment and evolution of nutritional modes. Clustering procedures and statistical tests were performed to assign trophic modes to Hymenochaetales and test for differences between varying ecologies. Genomes of Hymenochaetales were mined for presence of enzymes involved in plant cell wall and lignin degradation and sucrolytic activity. Key Results Three different trophic clusters were detected – biotrophic, saprotrophic, and a second biotrophic cluster including many bryophilous Hymenochaetales and mosses. Non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales are generally biotrophic. All lignicolous Hymenochaetales clustered as saprotrophic and most terricolous Hymenochaetales clustered as ectomycorrhizal. Overall, at least 15 species of Hymenochaetales are inferred as biotrophic. Bryophilous species of Rickenella can degrade plant cell walls and lignin, and cleave sucrose to glucose consistent with a parasitic or endophytic life style. Conclusions Most non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales are biotrophic. Stable isotope values of many bryophilous Hymenochaetales cluster as ectomycorrhizal or in a biotrophic cluster indicative of parasitism or an endophytic life style. Overall, trophic mode diversity in the Hymenochaetales is greater than anticipated, and non‐lignicolous ecological traits and biotrophic modes of nutrition are evolutionarily derived features.",1,0,0.6247891783714294,0.37521082162857056,0,biobert,True,1
"Recent studies have shown that M. elongata (M. elongata) isolated from Populus ﬁeld sites has a dual endophyte–saprotroph lifestyle and is able to promote the growth of Populus. However, little is known about the host ﬁdelity of M. elongata and whether M. elongata strains diﬀer from one another in their ability to promote plant growth. Here, we compared the impacts of three Populus-associated M. elongata isolates (PMI 77, PMI 93, and PMI 624) on the growth of seven diﬀerent crop species by measuring plant height, plant dry biomass, and leaf area. M. elongata isolates PMI 624 and PMI 93 increased the plant height, leaf area, and plant dry weight of Citrullus lanatus, Zea mays, Solanum lycopersicum, and Cucurbita to a much greater degree than PMI 77 (33.9\% to 14.1\%). No signiﬁcant impacts were observed for any isolate on the growth of Abelmoschus esculentus or Glycine max. On the contrary, Glycine max signiﬁcantly decreased in height by 30.6\% after the inoculation of M. elongata PMI 77. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that M. elongata generally promoted metrics of the plant performance among a diverse set of importantly non-leguminous crop species.

"Schizophyllum commune is a mushroom forming basidiomycete. It is considered a versatile fungus because of its global distribution, its high genotypic and phenotypic variability, and its growth under high pressure, high cosmic radiation, as well as aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The versatility of S. commune is also evident from the fact that it normally grows as a saprophyte on a wide variety of plant waste including wood but that it also can be a pathogen of plants and animals and may be an endophyte as well. Apart from its biology, S. commune is also versatile because it is a model system for mushroom formation, mycelium materials, and cell wall architecture and composition, while it also produces molecules of interest for medical and industrial applications.",1,0,0.579047441482544,0.4209524989128113,4,bert-base-uncased,True,1
"The frequency of infection, lesion characteristics and anatomical changes in phloem and cambial tissues caused by Armillaria sinapina were studied on inoculated trees of Douglas-ﬁr, western hemlock and western redcedar and compared with results of A. ostoyae inoculations previously reported on the same host species. Similar percentages of inoculations resulting in infection of roots on the three hosts indicate that A. sinapina and A. ostoyae are equally pathogenic. Armillaria ostoyae was more virulent than A. sinapina as demonstrated by fungal exudates from A. ostoyae inoculum blocks, which appeared to cause lesions on roots; the higher frequency at which ligniﬁed impervious tissue (IT) and necrophylactic periderm (NP) developed in bark and following cambial invasion, compartmentalization; the large proportion of roots that showed no visible host response; the large zones of IT formed under continuous stimulation by A. ostoyae advancing in inner bark; and the high frequency of breaching of NP barriers. Spread of A. sinapina mycelium in host species appeared slower than that of A. ostoyae, particularly in Douglas-ﬁr and western hemlock. In western redcedar, A. ostoyae induced stronger host responses than those following invasion by A. sinapina, which included further expansion of the induced rhytidome response, traumatic phloem resin duct formation and higher numbers of polyphenolic parenchyma comprising its barrier zone. Where damage by A. sinapina ensued, it was always associated with high inoculum potential.

"Tricholoma matsutake is an economically important ectomycorrhizal fungus of coniferous woodlands. Mycologists suspect that this fungus is also capable of saprotrophic feeding. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, enzyme and chemical assays were performed in the field and laboratory. From a natural population of T. matsutake in southern Finland, samples of soil–mycelium aggregate (shiro) were taken from sites of sporocarp formation and nearby control (PCR-negative) spots. Soil organic carbon and activity rates of hemicellulolytic enzymes were measured. The productivity of T. matsutake was related to the amount of utilizable organic carbon in the shiro, where the activity of xylosidase was significantly higher than in the control sample. In the laboratory, sterile pieces of bark from the roots of Scots pine were inoculated with T. matsutake and the activity rates of two hemicellulolytic enzymes (xylosidase and glucuronidase) were assayed. Furthermore, a liquid culture system showed how T. matsutake can utilize hemicellulose as its sole carbon source. Results linked and quantified the general relationship between enzymes secreted by T. matsutake and the degradation of hemicellulose. Our findings suggest that T. matsutake lives mainly as an ectomycorrhizal symbiont but can also feed as a saprotroph.
