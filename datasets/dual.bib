	abstract = {Alternaria alternata is a common species of fungus frequently isolated from plants as both an endophyte and a pathogen. Although the current definition of A. alternata rests on a foundation of morphological, genetic and genomic analyses, doubts persist regarding the scope of A. alternata within the genus due to the varied symbiotic interactions and wide host range observed in these fungi. These doubts may be due in large part to the history of unstable taxonomy in Alternaria, based on limited morphological characters for species delimitation and host specificity associated with toxins encoded by genes carried on conditionally dispensable chromosomes. This review explores the history of Alternaria taxonomy, focusing in particular on the use of nutritional mode and host associations in species delimitation, with the goal of evaluating A. alternata as it currently stands based on taxonomic best practice. Given the recombination detected among isolates of A. alternata, different symbiotic associations in this species should not be considered phylogenetically informative.},

Phomopsis liquidambari B3 can establish mutualistic symbiosis with a broad spectrum of crop plants. Colonizing dynamics observations and a growth promotion assay of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the B3 colonization strategy is host-adapted and resulted in diﬀerent growth promotions inﬂuenced by N availability. However, the biochemical mechanisms and underlying genetics of the saprophyte transition to an endophyte are poorly understood. Here, the transcriptome features of generalist P. liquidambari and highlighted gene sets involved in the lifestyle transition from saprophytism to endophytism were reported. Most notable were genes for translation, ribosome biogenesis and MAPK signaling, several of which were only up-regulated in endophytic B3. Coordinated up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were preceded by secondary metabolite induction, which was encountered with host defense. Quantitative PCR validates the reliability of RNA-seq. Dissection at the molecular level facilitated a deeper understanding of P. liquidambari adaptation to hosts and the complex natural environment to play a role in sustainable agriculture and carbon and nitrogen cycles.},

S. epidermidis is the most common cause of implantassociated infections and is a canonical opportunistic biofilm former. Additional emerging evidence suggests that some strains of S. epidermidis may contribute to the pathogenesis of common skin diseases.

              Fungi interact with their environment by secreting proteins to obtain nutrients, elicit responses and modify their surroundings. Because the set of proteins secreted by a fungus is related to its lifestyle, it should be possible to use it as a tool to predict fungal lifestyle. To test this hypothesis, we bioinformatically identified 538 and 554 secretable proteins in the monokaryotic strains PC9 and PC15 of the white rot basidiomycete
              Pleurotus ostreatus
              . Functional annotation revealed unknown functions (37.2\%), glycosyl hydrolases (26.5\%) and redox enzymes (11.5\%) as the main groups in the two strains. When these results were combined with RNA‐seq analyses, we found that the relative importance of each group was different in different strains and culture conditions and the relevance of the unknown function proteins was enhanced. Only a few genes were actively expressed in a given culture condition in expanded multigene families, suggesting that family expansi on could increase adaptive opportunities rather than activity under a specific culture condition. Finally, we used the set of
              P. ostreatus
              secreted proteins as a query to search their counterparts in other fungal genomes and found that the secretome profiles cluster the tested basidiomycetes into lifestyle rather than phylogenetic groups.},

Chalciporoideae is the earliest diverging lineage in Boletaceae and includes Chalciporus and Buchwaldoboletus. Buchwaldoboletus species fruit on wood and were thought to be saprobes, but the type species Buchwaldoboletus lignicola is mycoparasitic on the wood decay fungus Phaeolus schweinitzii. However, the nutritional mode and host range of B. lignicola and other Buchwaldoboletus remain unclear. We obtained fresh collections and axenic cultures of B. lignicola, B. hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus from the southeastern USA. We use cultures to examine the phylogenetic relationships among taxa in Chalciporoideae, elucidate the trophic mode of Buchwaldoboletus species and test the effect that Buchwaldoboletus species have on wood decay. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the Chalciporus lineage is sister to all other Boletaceae but suggests that Buchwaldoboletus is not monophyletic. Confrontation experiments on agar suggest that Buchwaldoboletus species might parasitize a wide range of decay fungi. Buchwaldoboletus hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus produce abundant conidia in culture whereas the more distantly related B. lignicola produces sclerotia. Wood decay assays show that Buchwaldoboletus species did not have a significant effect on the decay caused by wood decay fungi. Interestingly, when B. lignicola or B. hemichrysus were inoculated alone on wood both species decayed wood, producing a brown rot that can cause 35–65\% mass loss over 6 months. Our results suggest that Buchwaldoboletus species have a dual trophic mode as saprobes and mycoparasites.},

	abstract = {Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition often tends to negatively impact the functions of belowground ectomycorrhizal networks, although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this trait are still unclear. Here, we assess how the root-associated fungus Clitopilus hobsonii establishes an ectomycorrhiza-like association with its host tree Populus tomentosa and how this interaction is favored by organic N over mineral N. The establishment of a functional symbiosis in the presence of organic N promotes plant growth and the transfer of 15N from the fungus to above ground plant tissues. Genomic traits and in planta transcriptional signatures suggest that C. hobsonii may have a dual lifestyle with saprotrophic and mutualistic traits. For example, several genes involved in the digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose are highly expressed during the interaction, whereas the expression of multiple copies of pectin-digesting genes is tightly controlled. Conversely, the nutritional mutualism is dampened in the presence of ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3 ). Increasing levels of NH4+ led to a higher expression of pectin-digesting genes and a continuous increase in hydrogen peroxide production in roots, whereas the presence of NO3 resulted in toxin production. In summary, our results suggest that C. hobsonii is a facultative ectomycorrhizal fungus. Access to various forms of N acts as an on/off switch for mutualism caused by large-scale fungal physiological remodeling. Furthermore, the abundance of pectin-degrading enzymes with distinct expression patterns during functional divergence after exposure to NH4 + or organic N is likely to be central to the transition from parasitism to mutualism.},

However, little is known about the host ﬁdelity of M. elongata and whether M. elongata strains diﬀer from one another in their ability to promote plant growth. Here, we compared the impacts of three Populus-associated M. elongata isolates (PMI 77, PMI 93, and PMI 624) on the growth of seven diﬀerent crop species by measuring plant height, plant dry biomass, and leaf area. M. elongata isolates PMI 624 and PMI 93 increased the plant height, leaf area, and plant dry weight of Citrullus lanatus, Zea mays, Solanum lycopersicum, and Cucurbita to a much greater degree than PMI 77 (33.9\% to 14.1\%). No signiﬁcant impacts were observed for any isolate on the growth of Abelmoschus esculentus or Glycine max. On the contrary, Glycine max signiﬁcantly decreased in height by 30.6\% after the inoculation of M. elongata PMI 77. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that M. elongata generally promoted metrics of the plant performance among a diverse set of importantly non-leguminous crop species.

Many of those interactions are beneficial to the host plants and a few are detrimental. Several investigations have pointed towards the interconversion of one fungal lifestyle into another while interact the plant system meaning endophyte may become parasite or vice versa. In such case, it is necessary to realize whether these different lifestyles are interconnected at some points either by physiological, biochemical or molecular routes and to identify the factors that trigger the change in fungal lifestyle, which is entirely different than earlier one and affects the host plant significantly. This review highlights the possible mechanisms of switching among the lifestyles of fungi based on recent findings and discusses the factors affecting plant fungal interactions. It also underlines the need for studying this important facet of plant–fungal interactions in depth which may in future help to fetch more advantages and to avoid the severe consequences in agriculture and other related fields.},

	abstract = {Symbioses between cool season grasses and fungi of the family Clavicipitaceae are an integral component of both natural and agricultural ecosystems. An excellent experimental model is the association between the biotrophic fungus Epichloë festucae and Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass). The fungal partner produces a suite of secondary metabolites that protect the host from various biotic and abiotic stresses. The plant host provides a source of nutrients and a mechanism of dissemination via seed transmission. Crucial mechanisms that maintain a stable mutualistic association include signaling through the stress activated MAP kinase pathway and production of reactive oxygen species by the fungal NADPH oxidase (Nox) complex. Disruption of components of the Nox complex (NoxA, NoxR and RacA), or the stress-activated MAP kinase (SakA), leads to a breakdown in this ﬁnely balanced association, resulting in pathogenic infection instead of mutualism. Hosts infected with fungi lacking a functional Nox complex, or the stress-activated MAP kinase, display a stunted phenotype and undergo premature senescence, while the fungus switches from restricted to proliferative growth. To gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie these physiological changes, high throughput mRNA sequencing has been used to analyze the transcriptomes of both host and symbiont in wild-type and a mutant association. In the sakA mutant association, a dramatic upregulation of fungal hydrolases and transporters was observed, changes consistent with a switch from restricted symbiotic to proliferative pathogenic growth. Analysis of the plant transcriptome revealed dramatic changes in expression of host genes involved in pathogen defense, transposon activation and hormone biosynthesis and response. This review highlights how ﬁnely tuned grass-endophyte associations are, and how interfering with the signaling pathways involved in maintenance of these associations can trigger a change from mutualistic to pathogenic interaction.},

	abstract = {Endophytes typically coexist with plants in symbiosis and transition into the saprobic system as plant tissues senesce, participating in the decomposition process of litter. However, the dynamic changes of endophytic communities during this process and their role in litter decomposition remain unclear. This study tracked the microbial composition across the transition from live leaves to litter in

              (L.) Presl
              (C. camphora)
              , evaluating the contribution of endophytes to litter decomposition by examining microbial diversity, community assembly, and co-occurrence networks along the endophyte-to-saprotroph spectrum. The results revealed increasing bacterial diversity but stable fungal diversity, and the diversity of endogenous microbes is mirrored this in the saprophytic phase. Bacterial community assembly was characterized by deterministic processes during the symbiotic phase, shifted to stochastic processes during the saprophytic phase. In contrast, fungal community assembly was predominantly driven by stochastic processes throughout the continuum. Out of the 49 keystone taxa identified, only
              Pseudorhodoplanes sinuspersici
              demonstrated a significant positive correlation with community assembly. All identified bacterial keystone taxa during the saprophytic phase originated from endophytic sources, and around 80\% of the fungal keystone taxa in the initial stages of decomposition were similarly endophytic in origin. Additionally, 60\% of the dominant bacterial taxa and 28\% of the dominant fungal taxa at the commencement of decomposition were of endophytic descent. This suggests that endogenous microbes possess the potential to evolve into both keystone and dominant taxa during the saprophytic phase. Endogenous keystone and dominant microbes both exhibited significant correlations with microbial network, indicating their substantial ecological presence in microbial community. Both endogenous keystone and dominant taxa exerted significant potential influences on litter decomposition. Overall, during the saprophytic phase, endophytes are likely to influence the assemblage of microbial communities, the network structure, and decomposition-related functions. Specifically, it appears that bacterial endophytes may possess a greater adaptability to the decomposition processes of leaf litter compared to their fungal counterparts.},

In order to evaluate this hypothesis, enzyme and chemical assays were performed in the field and laboratory. From a natural population of T. matsutake in southern Finland, samples of soil–mycelium aggregate (shiro) were taken from sites of sporocarp formation and nearby control (PCR-negative) spots. Soil organic carbon and activity rates of hemicellulolytic enzymes were measured. The productivity of T. matsutake was related to the amount of utilizable  organic carbon in the shiro, where the activity of xylosidase was significantly higher than in the control sample. In the laboratory, sterile pieces of bark from the roots of Scots pine were inoculated with T. matsutake and the activity rates of two hemicellulolytic enzymes (xylosidase and glucuronidase) were assayed. Furthermore, a liquid culture system showed how T. matsutake can utilize hemicellulose as its sole carbon source. Results linked and quantified the general relationship between enzymes secreted by T. matsutake and the degradation of hemicellulose. Our findings suggest that T. matsutake lives mainly as an ectomycorrhizal symbiont but can also feed as a saprotroph. A flexible trophic ecology confers T. matsutake with a clear advantage in a heterogeneous environment and during sporocarp formation.},

The objective of this study was to infer the evolution of habitat preference (decaying plants, soil, living fungi, and living plants), and nutrition mode (saprotrophy and mycoparasitism) in the fungal genus Trichoderma to elucidate possible interkingdom host jumps and shifts in ecology. Host and ecological role shifts were inferred by phylogenetic analyses and ancestral character reconstructions. The results support several interkingdom host jumps and also show that the preference for a particular habitat was gained or lost multiple times. Diversification analysis revealed that mycoparasitism is associated with accelerated speciation rates, which then suggests that this trait may be linked to the high number of species in Trichoderma. In this study it was also possible to infer the cryptic roles that endophytes or soil inhabitants play in their hosts by evaluating their closest relatives and determining their most recent ancestors. Findings from this study may have implications for understanding certain evolutionary processes such as species radiations in some hyperdiverse groups of fungi, and for more applied fields such as the discovery and development of novel biological control strategies.},

	abstract = {Premise of the Study
              The Hymenochaetales are dominated by lignicolous saprotrophic fungi involved in wood decay. However, the group also includes bryophilous and terricolous taxa, but their modes of nutrition are not clear. Here, we investigate patterns of carbon and nitrogen utilization in numerous non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales and provide a phylogenetic context in which these non‐canonical ecological guilds arose.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We combined stable isotope analyses of δ

                C and δ
                15
                N and phylogenetic analyses to explore assignment and evolution of nutritional modes. Clustering procedures and statistical tests were performed to assign trophic modes to Hymenochaetales and test for differences between varying ecologies. Genomes of Hymenochaetales were mined for presence of enzymes involved in plant cell wall and lignin degradation and sucrolytic activity.
              
            
            
              Key Results
              
                Three different trophic clusters were detected – biotrophic, saprotrophic, and a second biotrophic cluster including many bryophilous Hymenochaetales and mosses. Non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales are generally biotrophic. All lignicolous Hymenochaetales clustered as saprotrophic and most terricolous Hymenochaetales clustered as ectomycorrhizal. Overall, at least 15 species of Hymenochaetales are inferred as biotrophic. Bryophilous species of
                Rickenella
                can degrade plant cell walls and lignin, and cleave sucrose to glucose consistent with a parasitic or endophytic life style.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Most non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales are biotrophic. Stable isotope values of many bryophilous Hymenochaetales cluster as ectomycorrhizal or in a biotrophic cluster indicative of parasitism or an endophytic life style. Overall, trophic mode diversity in the Hymenochaetales is greater than anticipated, and non‐lignicolous ecological traits and biotrophic modes of nutrition are evolutionarily derived features.},

Our results suggest that all three cases represent independent fungal phylogenetic species, which can undergo their whole sexual lifecycle either as lichens or as saprotrophs. • The use of different nutritional modes – optional lichenization – allows separate individuals to exploit different niches during the forest succession.

Here we report on the 25 Mb genome of the mutualistic root symbiont Piriformospora indica (Sebacinales, Basidiomycota) and provide a global characterization of fungal transcriptional responses associated with the colonization of living and dead barley roots. Extensive comparative analysis of the P. indica genome with other Basidiomycota and Ascomycota fungi that have diverse lifestyle strategies identified features typically associated with both, biotrophism and saprotrophism. The tightly controlled expression of the lifestyle-associated gene sets during the onset of the symbiosis, revealed by microarray analysis, argues for a biphasic root colonization strategy of P. indica. This is supported by a cytological study that shows an early biotrophic growth followed by a cell death-associated phase. About 10\% of the fungal genes induced during the biotrophic colonization encoded putative small secreted proteins (SSP), including several lectin-like proteins and members of a P. indica-specific gene family (DELD) with a conserved novel seven-amino acids motif at the C-terminus. Similar to effectors found in other filamentous organisms, the occurrence of the DELDs correlated with the presence of transposable elements in gene-poor repeat-rich regions of the genome. This is the first in depth genomic study describing a mutualistic symbiont with a biphasic lifestyle. Our findings provide a significant advance in understanding development of biotrophic plant symbionts and suggest a series of incremental shifts along the continuum from saprotrophy towards biotrophy in the evolution of mycorrhizal association from decomposer fungi.},

                    fungi have the capacity to decompose organic matter, and although there is increasing evidence that some saprotrophic fungi exhibit the capacity to enter into facultative biotrophic relationships with plant roots without causing disease symptoms, this subject is still not well studied.
                  
                
                
                  
                    In order to determine the extent of biotrophic capacity in saprotrophic wood‐decay fungi and which systems may be useful models, we investigated the colonization of conifer seedling roots
                    in vitro
                    using an array of 201 basidiomycete wood‐decay fungi. Microtome sectioning, differential staining and fluorescence microscopy were used to visualize patterns of root colonization in microcosm systems containing
                    Picea abies
                    or
                    Pinus sylvestris
                    seedlings and each saprotrophic fungus.
                  
                
                
                  Thirty‐four (16.9\%) of the tested fungal species colonized the roots of at least one tree species. Two fungal species showed formation of a mantle and one showed Hartig net‐like structures. These features suggest the possibility of an active functional symbiosis between fungus and plant.
                
                
                  The data indicate that the capacity for facultative biotrophic relationships in free‐living saprotrophic basidiomycetes may be greater than previously supposed.

Comparative analysis of the genomes of biotrophic species highlighted convergent evolution. Mutualistic and pathogenic biotrophic fungi share expansion of genome size through transposon proliferation and common strategies to avoid plant detection. Differences mainly rely on nutritional strategies. Such analyses also pinpointed how blurred the molecular boundaries are between saprotrophism, symbiosis and pathogenesis. Sequencing of additional ECM species, as well as soil saprotrophic fungi, will facilitate the identification of conserved traits for ECM symbiosis and those leading to the transition from white-rotting and brown-rotting to the ECM lifestyle.},

Ribosomal DNA-based sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationships from 99 fungal isolates (endophytes, mycelia sterilia, and saprotrophs) recovered from leaves and twigs of Magnolia liliifera were investigated in this study. Molecular data suggest there are fungal taxa that possibly exist as endophytes and saprotrophs. Isolates of Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Guignardia, and Phomopsis, which are common plant endophytes, have high sequence similarity and are phylogenetically related to their saprotrophic counterparts. This provides evidence to suggest that some endophytic species change their ecological strategies and adopt a saprotrophic lifestyle. The implication of these findings on fungal biodiversity and host specificity is also discussed.},

              Nonphotosynthetic mycorrhizal plants have long attracted the curiosity of botanists and mycologists, and they have been a target for unabated controversy and speculation. In fact, these puzzling plants dominated the very beginnings of the field of mycorrhizal biology. However, only recently has the mycorrhizal biology of this diverse group of plants begun to be systematically unravelled, largely following a landmark Tansley review a decade ago and crucial developments in the field of molecular ecology. Here I explore our knowledge of these evolutionarily and ecologically diverse plant–fungal symbioses, highlighting areas where there has been significant progress. The focus is on what is arguably the best understood example, the monotropoid mycorrhizal symbiosis, and the overarching goal is to lay out the questions that remain to be answered about the biology of myco‐heterotrophy and epiparasitism.

	abstract = {Summary
          Recently, several saprotrophic genera have been found to invade/interact with plant roots in laboratory growth experiments, and this coincides with reports of abundant saprotrophic fungal sequences in plant roots. However, it is uncertain if this reflects field phenomena, and if reports on coincidentally amplified saprotrophs are simply coincidental.
          
            We investigated root invasion by presumed saprotrophic fungi by focusing on the large genus
            Mycena
            in
            1)
            a systematic analysis of the occurrence of saprotrophic fungi in new and previously published ITS1/ITS2 datasets generated from roots of 10 mycorrhizal plant species, and
            2)
            we analysed natural abundances of
            13
            C/
            15
            N stable isotope signatures of fungal/plant communities from five comparable field locations to examine the trophic status of
            Mycena
            species.
          
          
            Mycena
            was the only saprotrophic genus consistently found in 9 of 10 plant host roots, with high within-host variation in
            Mycena
            sequence proportions (0-80\%) recovered.
            Mycena
            carpophores displayed isotopic signatures consistent with published
            13
            C/
            15
            N profiles of both saprotrophic or mutualistic lifestyles, with considerable intraspecific variation, resembling the patterns seen in growth experiments. These results indicate that multiple
            Mycena
            species opportunistically invade the roots of a range of plant species, possibly forming a spectrum of interactions. This potentially challenges our general understanding of fungal ecology.
          
          
            Originality significance statement
            
              This is the first study to apply a dual approach of systematic metabarcoding of plant roots and stable isotope signatures on dried field material to the large and common saprotrophic fungal genus
              Mycena
              . This is significant as it shows that members of this genus, normally not expected to be found inside plant roots at all, are in fact associated eith multiple plant hosts. The study furthermore shows that species in this genus may occupy different ecological roles in the field besides being saprotrophic. That a large and common fungal genus known to be a quantitatively important litter decayer can be an opportunistic root invader and interact with host plants is of interest to all mycologists and ecologists working on plant-fungus/microb symbiosis.},

We focus primarily on species in the genera Metarhizium and Beauveria, traditionally recognized as insect pathogenic fungi but are also found as plant symbionts. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these fungi are more closely related to grass endophytes and diverged from that lineage ca. 100 MYA. We explore how the dual life cycles of these fungi as insect pathogens and endophytes are coupled. We discuss the evolution of insect pathogenesis while maintaining an endophytic lifestyle and provide examples of genes that may be involved in the transition toward insect pathogenicity. That is, some genes for insect pathogenesis may have been co-opted from genes involved in endophytic colonization. Other genes may be multifunctional and serve in both lifestyle capacities. We suggest that their evolution as insect pathogens allowed them to effectively barter a specialized nitrogen source (i.e. insects) with host plants for photosynthate. These ubiquitous fungi may play an important role as plant growth promoters and have a potential reservoir of secondary metabolites.},
