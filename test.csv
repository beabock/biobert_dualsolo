"Filamentous ascomycete Phomopsis sp. are common inhabitants of natural ecosystems and, as saprophytes, are largely responsible for the destructive decay of litterfall, promoting the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Phomopsis liquidambari B3 can establish mutualistic symbiosis with a broad spectrum of crop plants. Colonizing dynamics observations and a growth promotion assay of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the B3 colonization strategy is host-adapted and resulted in diﬀerent growth promotions inﬂuenced by N availability. However, the biochemical mechanisms and underlying genetics of the saprophyte transition to an endophyte are poorly understood. Here, the transcriptome features of generalist P. liquidambari and highlighted gene sets involved in the lifestyle transition from saprophytism to endophytism were reported. Most notable were genes for translation, ribosome biogenesis and MAPK signaling, several of which were only up-regulated in endophytic B3. Coordinated up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were preceded by secondary metabolite induction, which was encountered with host defense. Quantitative PCR validates the reliability of RNA-seq. Dissection at the molecular level facilitated a deeper understanding of P. liquidambari adaptation to hosts and the complex natural environment to play a role in sustainable agriculture and carbon and nitrogen cycles.",1,Endophytism or saprophytism: {Decoding} the lifestyle transition of the generalist fungus {Phomopsis} liquidambari,
"Candida spp. are part of the normal vaginal microﬂora in 20e30\% of healthy women. However, if the balance between these yeasts and the host is disturbed, Candida spp. can cause vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), with Candida albicans being the major causative agent. Different studies have been performed in order to better understand Candida's dual lifestyle in the vagina. The potential of C. albicans to switch from the yeast cell morphology to its hyphal form is considered a key element in VVC pathogenesis. Candida spp. also express other virulence factors, such as hydrolytic extracellular enzymes and heat shock proteins and can form bioﬁlms.",1,Candida and its dual lifestyle as a commensal and a pathogen,
"Most Boletaceae form ectomycorrhizas but species in two sister groups (subfamily Chalciporoideae and the genus Pseudoboletus) have unclear trophic modes and are putatively mycoparasitic. Chalciporoideae is the earliest diverging lineage in Boletaceae and includes Chalciporus and Buchwaldoboletus. Buchwaldoboletus species fruit on wood and were thought to be saprobes, but the type species Buchwaldoboletus lignicola is mycoparasitic on the wood decay fungus Phaeolus schweinitzii. However, the nutritional mode and host range of B. lignicola and other Buchwaldoboletus remain unclear. We obtained fresh collections and axenic cultures of B. lignicola, B. hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus from the southeastern USA. We use cultures to examine the phylogenetic relationships among taxa in Chalciporoideae, elucidate the trophic mode of Buchwaldoboletus species and test the effect that Buchwaldoboletus species have on wood decay. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the Chalciporus lineage is sister to all other Boletaceae but suggests that Buchwaldoboletus is not monophyletic. Confrontation experiments on agar suggest that Buchwaldoboletus species might parasitize a wide range of decay fungi. Buchwaldoboletus hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus produce abundant conidia in culture whereas the more distantly related B. lignicola produces sclerotia. Wood decay assays show that Buchwaldoboletus species did not have a significant effect on the decay caused by wood decay fungi. Interestingly, when B. lignicola or B. hemichrysus were inoculated alone on wood both species decayed wood, producing a brown rot that can cause 35–65\% mass loss over 6 months. Our results suggest that Buchwaldoboletus species have a dual trophic mode as saprobes and mycoparasites.",1,"Polyphyly, asexual reproduction and dual trophic mode in {Buchwaldoboletus}",
"Recent studies have shown that M. elongata (M. elongata) isolated from Populus ﬁeld sites has a dual endophyte–saprotroph lifestyle and is able to promote the growth of Populus. However, little is known about the host ﬁdelity of M. elongata and whether M. elongata strains diﬀer from one another in their ability to promote plant growth. Here, we compared the impacts of three Populus-associated M. elongata isolates (PMI 77, PMI 93, and PMI 624) on the growth of seven diﬀerent crop species by measuring plant height, plant dry biomass, and leaf area. M. elongata isolates PMI 624 and PMI 93 increased the plant height, leaf area, and plant dry weight of Citrullus lanatus, Zea mays, Solanum lycopersicum, and Cucurbita to a much greater degree than PMI 77 (33.9\% to 14.1\%). No signiﬁcant impacts were observed for any isolate on the growth of Abelmoschus esculentus or Glycine max. On the contrary, Glycine max signiﬁcantly decreased in height by 30.6\% after the inoculation of M. elongata PMI 77. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that M. elongata generally promoted metrics of the plant performance among a diverse set of importantly non-leguminous crop species. Future research on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie strain and host variability is warranted.",1,Mortierella elongata {Increases} {Plant} {Biomass} among {Non}-{Leguminous} {Crop} {Species},
"Tricholoma matsutake is an economically important ectomycorrhizal fungus of coniferous woodlands. Mycologists suspect that this fungus is also capable of saprotrophic feeding. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, enzyme and chemical assays were performed in the field and laboratory. From a natural population of T. matsutake in southern Finland, samples of soil–mycelium aggregate (shiro) were taken from sites of sporocarp formation and nearby control (PCR-negative) spots. Soil organic carbon and activity rates of hemicellulolytic enzymes were measured. The productivity of T. matsutake was related to the amount of utilizable organic carbon in the shiro, where the activity of xylosidase was significantly higher than in the control sample. In the laboratory, sterile pieces of bark from the roots of Scots pine were inoculated with T. matsutake and the activity rates of two hemicellulolytic enzymes (xylosidase and glucuronidase) were assayed. Furthermore, a liquid culture system showed how T. matsutake can utilize hemicellulose as its sole carbon source. Results linked and quantified the general relationship between enzymes secreted by T. matsutake and the degradation of hemicellulose. Our findings suggest that T. matsutake lives mainly as an ectomycorrhizal symbiont but can also feed as a saprotroph. A flexible trophic ecology confers T. matsutake with a clear advantage in a heterogeneous environment and during sporocarp formation.",1,The ectomycorrhizal fungus {Tricholoma} matsutake is a facultative saprotroph in vitro,
"Fungi play crucial roles in the biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems, most notably as saprophytes decomposing organic matter and as mycorrhizal fungi enhancing plant nutrient uptake. However, a recurrent problem in fungal ecology is to establish the trophic status of species in the field. Our interpretations and conclusions are too often based on extrapolations from laboratory microcosm experiments or on anecdotal field evidence. Here, we used natural variations in stable carbon isotope ratios (δ 13 C) as an approach to distinguish between fungal decomposers and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungal species in the rich sporocarp flora (our sample contains 135 species) of temperate forests. We also demonstrated that host-specific mycorrhizal fungi that receive C from overstorey or understorey tree species differ in their δ 13 C. The many promiscuous mycorrhizal fungi, associated with and connecting several tree hosts, were calculated to receive 57–100\% of their C from overstorey trees. Thus, overstorey trees also support, partly or wholly, the nutrient-absorbing mycelia of their alleged competitors, the understorey trees.",1,Natural$^{\textrm{13}}$ {C} abundance reveals trophic status of fungi and host-origin of carbon in mycorrhizal fungi in mixed forests,
"Recent sequencing projects have provided deep insight into fungal lifestyle-associated genomic adaptations. Here we report on the 25 Mb genome of the mutualistic root symbiont Piriformospora indica (Sebacinales, Basidiomycota) and provide a global characterization of fungal transcriptional responses associated with the colonization of living and dead barley roots. Extensive comparative analysis of the P. indica genome with other Basidiomycota and Ascomycota fungi that have diverse lifestyle strategies identified features typically associated with both, biotrophism and saprotrophism. The tightly controlled expression of the lifestyle-associated gene sets during the onset of the symbiosis, revealed by microarray analysis, argues for a biphasic root colonization strategy of P. indica. This is supported by a cytological study that shows an early biotrophic growth followed by a cell death-associated phase. About 10\% of the fungal genes induced during the biotrophic colonization encoded putative small secreted proteins (SSP), including several lectin-like proteins and members of a P. indica-specific gene family (DELD) with a conserved novel seven-amino acids motif at the C-terminus. Similar to effectors found in other filamentous organisms, the occurrence of the DELDs correlated with the presence of transposable elements in gene-poor repeat-rich regions of the genome. This is the first in depth genomic study describing a mutualistic symbiont with a biphasic lifestyle. Our findings provide a significant advance in understanding development of biotrophic plant symbionts and suggest a series of incremental shifts along the continuum from saprotrophy towards biotrophy in the evolution of mycorrhizal association from decomposer fungi.",1,Endophytic {Life} {Strategies} {Decoded} by {Genome} and {Transcriptome} {Analyses} of the {Mutualistic} {Root} {Symbiont} {Piriformospora} indica,
"Summary Ectomycorrhizal ( ECM ) symbioses have evolved a minimum of 78 times independently from saprotrophic lineages, indicating the potential for functional overlap between ECM and saprotrophic fungi. ECM fungi have the capacity to decompose organic matter, and although there is increasing evidence that some saprotrophic fungi exhibit the capacity to enter into facultative biotrophic relationships with plant roots without causing disease symptoms, this subject is still not well studied. In order to determine the extent of biotrophic capacity in saprotrophic wood‐decay fungi and which systems may be useful models, we investigated the colonization of conifer seedling roots in vitro using an array of 201 basidiomycete wood‐decay fungi. Microtome sectioning, differential staining and fluorescence microscopy were used to visualize patterns of root colonization in microcosm systems containing Picea abies or Pinus sylvestris seedlings and each saprotrophic fungus. Thirty‐four (16.9\%) of the tested fungal species colonized the roots of at least one tree species. Two fungal species showed formation of a mantle and one showed Hartig net‐like structures. These features suggest the possibility of an active functional symbiosis between fungus and plant. The data indicate that the capacity for facultative biotrophic relationships in free‐living saprotrophic basidiomycetes may be greater than previously supposed. , See also the Commentary on this article by Baldrian \& Kohout, 215 : 511–513 .",1,Growing evidence for facultative biotrophy in saprotrophic fungi: data from microcosm tests with 201 species of wood‐decay basidiomycetes,
"Saprophytic, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and pathogenic fungi play a key role in carbon and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Whereas more than 50 genomes of saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi have been published, only two genomes of ECM fungi, Laccaria bicolor and Tuber melanosporum, have been released. Comparative analysis of the genomes of biotrophic species highlighted convergent evolution. Mutualistic and pathogenic biotrophic fungi share expansion of genome size through transposon proliferation and common strategies to avoid plant detection. Differences mainly rely on nutritional strategies. Such analyses also pinpointed how blurred the molecular boundaries are between saprotrophism, symbiosis and pathogenesis. Sequencing of additional ECM species, as well as soil saprotrophic fungi, will facilitate the identification of conserved traits for ECM symbiosis and those leading to the transition from white-rotting and brown-rotting to the ECM lifestyle.",1,Mutualistic interactions on a knife-edge between saprotrophy and pathogenesis,
"Fungal endophytes and saprotrophs generally play an important ecological role within plant tissues and dead plant material. Several reports based solely on morphological observations have postulated that there is an intimate link between endophytes and saprotrophs. This study aims to provide valuable insight as to whether some endophytic fungi manifest themselves as saprotrophs upon host decay. Ribosomal DNA-based sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationships from 99 fungal isolates (endophytes, mycelia sterilia, and saprotrophs) recovered from leaves and twigs of Magnolia liliifera were investigated in this study. Molecular data suggest there are fungal taxa that possibly exist as endophytes and saprotrophs. Isolates of Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Guignardia, and Phomopsis, which are common plant endophytes, have high sequence similarity and are phylogenetically related to their saprotrophic counterparts. This provides evidence to suggest that some endophytic species change their ecological strategies and adopt a saprotrophic lifestyle. The implication of these findings on fungal biodiversity and host specificity is also discussed.",1,A {Phylogenetic} {Evaluation} of {Whether} {Endophytes} {Become} {Saprotrophs} at {Host} {Senescence},
"The frequency of infection, lesion characteristics and anatomical changes in phloem and cambial tissues caused by Armillaria sinapina were studied on inoculated trees of Douglas-ﬁr, western hemlock and western redcedar and compared with results of A. ostoyae inoculations previously reported on the same host species. Similar percentages of inoculations resulting in infection of roots on the three hosts indicate that A. sinapina and A. ostoyae are equally pathogenic. Armillaria ostoyae was more virulent than A. sinapina as demonstrated by fungal exudates from A. ostoyae inoculum blocks, which appeared to cause lesions on roots; the higher frequency at which ligniﬁed impervious tissue (IT) and necrophylactic periderm (NP) developed in bark and following cambial invasion, compartmentalization; the large proportion of roots that showed no visible host response; the large zones of IT formed under continuous stimulation by A. ostoyae advancing in inner bark; and the high frequency of breaching of NP barriers. Spread of A. sinapina mycelium in host species appeared slower than that of A. ostoyae, particularly in Douglas-ﬁr and western hemlock. In western redcedar, A. ostoyae induced stronger host responses than those following invasion by A. sinapina, which included further expansion of the induced rhytidome response, traumatic phloem resin duct formation and higher numbers of polyphenolic parenchyma comprising its barrier zone. Where damage by A. sinapina ensued, it was always associated with high inoculum potential.

"Arbutoid mycorrhizal plants are commonly found as understory vegetation in forests worldwide where ectomycorrhiza-forming trees occur. Comarostaphylis arbutoides (Ericaceae) is a tropical woody plant and common in tropical Central America. This plant forms arbutoid mycorrhiza, whereas only associations with Leccinum monticola as well as Sebacina sp. are described so far. We collected arbutoid mycorrhizas of C. arbutoides from the Cerro de la Muerte (Cordillera de Talamanca), Costa Rica, where this plant species grows together with Quercus costaricensis. We provide here the first evidence of mycorrhizal status for the Ascomycete Leotia cf. lubrica (Helotiales) that was so far under discussion as saprophyte or mycorrhizal.

"Four morphologically similar specimens of an unidentified perithecial ascomycete were collected on decaying wood submerged in fresh water. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from protein-coding and ribosomal nuclear loci supports the placement of the unidentified fungus together with Achroceratosphaeria in a strongly supported monophyletic clade.

"The family Stachybotriaceae was recently introduced to include the genera Myrothecium , Peethambara and Stachybotrys . Members of this family include important plant and human pathogens, as well as several species used in industrial and commercial applications as biodegraders and biocontrol agents. However, the generic boundaries in Stachybotriaceae are still poorly defined, as type material and sequence data are not readily available for taxonomic studies. To address this issue, we performed multi-locus phylogenetic analyses using partial gene sequences of the 28S large subunit (LSU), the internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nrRNA (ITS), the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit ( rpb2 ), calmodulin ( cmdA ), translation elongation factor 1-alpha ( tef1 ) and β-tubulin ( tub2 ) for all available type and authentic strains.

"Extremely acidic soils (pH{<}3) harbour poorly diversified mycobiota that are very different from less acidic habitats. During investigations of the mycobiota from several highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic and a coastal site in the Antarctic Peninsula, a group of hyaline fungal isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates belonged to three phylogenetic lineages within two different classes, Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes (Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). The first lineage is described here as a new genus and species Acidothrix acidophila gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Amplistromataceae, Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota).

"Abstract The family Tricholomataceae, contained within the Tricholomatoid clade, has traditionally been one of the largest families of the Agaricales. However, in this sense it is highly polyphyletic and requires emendation. Here, we present a phylogeny of the Tricholomatoid clade based on nucleotide sequence data from two nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (large subunit and small subunit) and the second‐largest subunit of RNA polymerase II ( rpb2 ). Our aim is to delimit the Tricholomataceae and identify monophyletic groups within the Tricholomatoid clade. We also infer a separate phylogeny, based on the three genes above, in addition to sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), in order to evaluate generic‐level boundaries within the Tricholomataceae s.str. Based on this analysis we recover seven monophyletic genera within the Tricholomataceae s.str. that correspond to Leucopaxillus, Tricholoma, Pseudotricholoma stat. nov., Porpolomas .str., Dennisiomyces, Corneriella gen. nov., and Albomagister gen. nov. Of the 98 genera that have been traditionally assigned to the Tricholomataceae sensu Singer, only four can be placed within it ( Tricholoma, Porpoloma, Dennisiomyces, Leucopaxillus ).
