"Alternaria alternata is a common species of fungus frequently isolated from plants as both an endophyte and a pathogen. Although the current definition of A. alternata rests on a foundation of morphological, genetic and genomic analyses, doubts persist regarding the scope of A. alternata within the genus due to the varied symbiotic interactions and wide host range observed in these fungi. These doubts may be due in large part to the history of unstable taxonomy in Alternaria, based on limited morphological characters for species delimitation and host specificity associated with toxins encoded by genes carried on conditionally dispensable chromosomes. This review explores the history of Alternaria taxonomy, focusing in particular on the use of nutritional mode and host associations in species delimitation, with the goal of evaluating A. alternata as it currently stands based on taxonomic best practice. Given the recombination detected among isolates of A. alternata, different symbiotic associations in this species should not be considered phylogenetically informative.",1,Alternaria alternata as endophyte and pathogen,comps
"Filamentous ascomycete Phomopsis sp. are common inhabitants of natural ecosystems and, as saprophytes, are largely responsible for the destructive decay of litterfall, promoting the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Phomopsis liquidambari B3 can establish mutualistic symbiosis with a broad spectrum of crop plants. Colonizing dynamics observations and a growth promotion assay of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the B3 colonization strategy is host-adapted and resulted in diﬀerent growth promotions inﬂuenced by N availability. However, the biochemical mechanisms and underlying genetics of the saprophyte transition to an endophyte are poorly understood. Here, the transcriptome features of generalist P. liquidambari and highlighted gene sets involved in the lifestyle transition from saprophytism to endophytism were reported. Most notable were genes for translation, ribosome biogenesis and MAPK signaling, several of which were only up-regulated in endophytic B3. Coordinated up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were preceded by secondary metabolite induction, which was encountered with host defense. Quantitative PCR validates the reliability of RNA-seq. Dissection at the molecular level facilitated a deeper understanding of P. liquidambari adaptation to hosts and the complex natural environment to play a role in sustainable agriculture and carbon and nitrogen cycles.",1,Endophytism or saprophytism: {Decoding} the lifestyle transition of the generalist fungus {Phomopsis} liquidambari,
"Candida spp. are part of the normal vaginal microﬂora in 20e30\% of healthy women. However, if the balance between these yeasts and the host is disturbed, Candida spp. can cause vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), with Candida albicans being the major causative agent. Different studies have been performed in order to better understand Candida's dual lifestyle in the vagina. The potential of C. albicans to switch from the yeast cell morphology to its hyphal form is considered a key element in VVC pathogenesis. Candida spp. also express other virulence factors, such as hydrolytic extracellular enzymes and heat shock proteins and can form bioﬁlms.",1,Candida and its dual lifestyle as a commensal and a pathogen,
"The coagulase-negative bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis is a member of the human skin microbiota. S. epidermidis is not merely a passive resident on skin but actively primes the cutaneous immune response, maintains skin homeostasis and prevents opportunistic pathogens from causing disease via colonization resistance. However, it is now appreciated that S. epidermidis and its interactions with the host exist on a spectrum of potential pathogenicity derived from its high strain-level heterogeneity. S. epidermidis is the most common cause of implantassociated infections and is a canonical opportunistic biofilm former. Additional emerging evidence suggests that some strains of S. epidermidis may contribute to the pathogenesis of common skin diseases. Here, we highlight new developments in our understanding of S. epidermidis strain diversity, skin colonization dynamics and its multifaceted interactions with the host and other members of the skin microbiota.",1,Staphylococcus epidermidis and its dual lifestyle in skin health and infection,
"The genus Diaporthe encompasses important plant pathogens, endophytes, and saprobes that are widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions. An accurate detection and identiﬁcation of plant pathogens not only allows correct disease diagnosis but also increases the accuracy of taxonomic ambiguities for fungal-plant interactions purposes. Multi-omics approaches applied to this genus may represent valuable tools to unravel molecular mechanisms involved in the infection processes. Additionally, omics can provide adaptation patterns that make pathogens thrive under changing environmental conditions, and insights into the dual pathogen-endophyte lifestyle. Therefore, all published data covered in this literature review represents an important contribution to deepen the knowledge on the importance of omics in fungal-plant interactions. This accumulating evidence will speed up the research on formulating new strategies to control plant pathologies, to assist in the exploitation of endophytes for their function in plant hosts, and to underline molecular factors of fungal pathogenicity and endophytism in the genus Diaporthe.",1,Mechanisms {Underlying} the {Pathogenic} and {Endophytic} {Lifestyles} in {Diaporthe}: {An} {Omics}-{Based} {Approach},
"Schizophyllum commune is a mushroom forming basidiomycete. It is considered a versatile fungus because of its global distribution, its high genotypic and phenotypic variability, and its growth under high pressure, high cosmic radiation, as well as aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The versatility of S. commune is also evident from the fact that it normally grows as a saprophyte on a wide variety of plant waste including wood but that it also can be a pathogen of plants and animals and may be an endophyte as well. Apart from its biology, S. commune is also versatile because it is a model system for mushroom formation, mycelium materials, and cell wall architecture and composition, while it also produces molecules of interest for medical and industrial applications.",1,The versatility of {Schizophyllum} commune in nature and application,
"Summary Fungi interact with their environment by secreting proteins to obtain nutrients, elicit responses and modify their surroundings. Because the set of proteins secreted by a fungus is related to its lifestyle, it should be possible to use it as a tool to predict fungal lifestyle. To test this hypothesis, we bioinformatically identified 538 and 554 secretable proteins in the monokaryotic strains PC9 and PC15 of the white rot basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus . Functional annotation revealed unknown functions (37.2\%), glycosyl hydrolases (26.5\%) and redox enzymes (11.5\%) as the main groups in the two strains. When these results were combined with RNA‐seq analyses, we found that the relative importance of each group was different in different strains and culture conditions and the relevance of the unknown function proteins was enhanced. Only a few genes were actively expressed in a given culture condition in expanded multigene families, suggesting that family expansi on could increase adaptive opportunities rather than activity under a specific culture condition. Finally, we used the set of P. ostreatus secreted proteins as a query to search their counterparts in other fungal genomes and found that the secretome profiles cluster the tested basidiomycetes into lifestyle rather than phylogenetic groups.",1,Comparative and transcriptional analysis of the predicted secretome in the lignocellulose‐degrading basidiomycete fungus {Pleurotus ostreatus},
"Most Boletaceae form ectomycorrhizas but species in two sister groups (subfamily Chalciporoideae and the genus Pseudoboletus) have unclear trophic modes and are putatively mycoparasitic. Chalciporoideae is the earliest diverging lineage in Boletaceae and includes Chalciporus and Buchwaldoboletus. Buchwaldoboletus species fruit on wood and were thought to be saprobes, but the type species Buchwaldoboletus lignicola is mycoparasitic on the wood decay fungus Phaeolus schweinitzii. However, the nutritional mode and host range of B. lignicola and other Buchwaldoboletus remain unclear. We obtained fresh collections and axenic cultures of B. lignicola, B. hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus from the southeastern USA. We use cultures to examine the phylogenetic relationships among taxa in Chalciporoideae, elucidate the trophic mode of Buchwaldoboletus species and test the effect that Buchwaldoboletus species have on wood decay. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the Chalciporus lineage is sister to all other Boletaceae but suggests that Buchwaldoboletus is not monophyletic. Confrontation experiments on agar suggest that Buchwaldoboletus species might parasitize a wide range of decay fungi. Buchwaldoboletus hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus produce abundant conidia in culture whereas the more distantly related B. lignicola produces sclerotia. Wood decay assays show that Buchwaldoboletus species did not have a significant effect on the decay caused by wood decay fungi. Interestingly, when B. lignicola or B. hemichrysus were inoculated alone on wood both species decayed wood, producing a brown rot that can cause 35–65\% mass loss over 6 months. Our results suggest that Buchwaldoboletus species have a dual trophic mode as saprobes and mycoparasites.",1,"Polyphyly, asexual reproduction and dual trophic mode in {Buchwaldoboletus}",
"Apple trees [ Malus domestica Borkh. ( Rosaceae )] are one of the important temperate fruit crops in China. In comparison to other temperate fruits, such as grapes and pears, fungal studies (in Yunnan) associated with M. domestica are fewer in number. In the present study, we investigated fungi associated with M. domestica in Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China. Samples were collected from apple gardens in different locations. Single spore isolation was carried out to isolate saprobic fungi, while the surface sterilization method was carried out to isolate endophytic fungi. Molecular analyses were carried out to determine the phylogenetic placement of the new collections. Based on the combined methods of morphology and phylogeny, Cytospora qujingensis sp. nov. and Hypoxylon malongense sp. nov. are introduced as novel saprobic and endophytic taxa, respectively. Moreover, Aureobasidium pullulans and Cytospora schulzeri are reported as new geological records from southwestern China. Allocryptovalsa castaneae is reported on M. domestica in China for the first time.

"Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition often tends to negatively impact the functions of belowground ectomycorrhizal networks, although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this trait are still unclear. Here, we assess how the root-associated fungus Clitopilus hobsonii establishes an ectomycorrhiza-like association with its host tree Populus tomentosa and how this interaction is favored by organic N over mineral N. The establishment of a functional symbiosis in the presence of organic N promotes plant growth and the transfer of 15N from the fungus to above ground plant tissues. Genomic traits and in planta transcriptional signatures suggest that C. hobsonii may have a dual lifestyle with saprotrophic and mutualistic traits. For example, several genes involved in the digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose are highly expressed during the interaction, whereas the expression of multiple copies of pectin-digesting genes is tightly controlled. Conversely, the nutritional mutualism is dampened in the presence of ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3 ). Increasing levels of NH4+ led to a higher expression of pectin-digesting genes and a continuous increase in hydrogen peroxide production in roots, whereas the presence of NO3 resulted in toxin production. In summary, our results suggest that C. hobsonii is a facultative ectomycorrhizal fungus. Access to various forms of N acts as an on/off switch for mutualism caused by large-scale fungal physiological remodeling. Furthermore, the abundance of pectin-degrading enzymes with distinct expression patterns during functional divergence after exposure to NH4 + or organic N is likely to be central to the transition from parasitism to mutualism.",1,A facultative ectomycorrhizal association is triggered by organic nitrogen,
"Recent studies have shown that M. elongata (M. elongata) isolated from Populus ﬁeld sites has a dual endophyte–saprotroph lifestyle and is able to promote the growth of Populus. However, little is known about the host ﬁdelity of M. elongata and whether M. elongata strains diﬀer from one another in their ability to promote plant growth. Here, we compared the impacts of three Populus-associated M. elongata isolates (PMI 77, PMI 93, and PMI 624) on the growth of seven diﬀerent crop species by measuring plant height, plant dry biomass, and leaf area. M. elongata isolates PMI 624 and PMI 93 increased the plant height, leaf area, and plant dry weight of Citrullus lanatus, Zea mays, Solanum lycopersicum, and Cucurbita to a much greater degree than PMI 77 (33.9\% to 14.1\%). No signiﬁcant impacts were observed for any isolate on the growth of Abelmoschus esculentus or Glycine max. On the contrary, Glycine max signiﬁcantly decreased in height by 30.6\% after the inoculation of M. elongata PMI 77. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that M. elongata generally promoted metrics of the plant performance among a diverse set of importantly non-leguminous crop species. Future research on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie strain and host variability is warranted.",1,Mortierella elongata {Increases} {Plant} {Biomass} among {Non}-{Leguminous} {Crop} {Species},
"Up till now various plant–fungal interactions have been extensively studied in the form of mycorrhizal, parasitic or endophytic lifestyles. Many of those interactions are beneficial to the host plants and a few are detrimental. Several investigations have pointed towards the interconversion of one fungal lifestyle into another while interact the plant system meaning endophyte may become parasite or vice versa. In such case, it is necessary to realize whether these different lifestyles are interconnected at some points either by physiological, biochemical or molecular routes and to identify the factors that trigger the change in fungal lifestyle, which is entirely different than earlier one and affects the host plant significantly. This review highlights the possible mechanisms of switching among the lifestyles of fungi based on recent findings and discusses the factors affecting plant fungal interactions. It also underlines the need for studying this important facet of plant–fungal interactions in depth which may in future help to fetch more advantages and to avoid the severe consequences in agriculture and other related fields.",1,Plant–fungal interactions: {What} triggers the fungi to switch among lifestyles?,
"Symbioses between cool season grasses and fungi of the family Clavicipitaceae are an integral component of both natural and agricultural ecosystems. An excellent experimental model is the association between the biotrophic fungus Epichloë festucae and Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass). The fungal partner produces a suite of secondary metabolites that protect the host from various biotic and abiotic stresses. The plant host provides a source of nutrients and a mechanism of dissemination via seed transmission. Crucial mechanisms that maintain a stable mutualistic association include signaling through the stress activated MAP kinase pathway and production of reactive oxygen species by the fungal NADPH oxidase (Nox) complex. Disruption of components of the Nox complex (NoxA, NoxR and RacA), or the stress-activated MAP kinase (SakA), leads to a breakdown in this ﬁnely balanced association, resulting in pathogenic infection instead of mutualism. Hosts infected with fungi lacking a functional Nox complex, or the stress-activated MAP kinase, display a stunted phenotype and undergo premature senescence, while the fungus switches from restricted to proliferative growth. To gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie these physiological changes, high throughput mRNA sequencing has been used to analyze the transcriptomes of both host and symbiont in wild-type and a mutant association. In the sakA mutant association, a dramatic upregulation of fungal hydrolases and transporters was observed, changes consistent with a switch from restricted symbiotic to proliferative pathogenic growth. Analysis of the plant transcriptome revealed dramatic changes in expression of host genes involved in pathogen defense, transposon activation and hormone biosynthesis and response. This review highlights how ﬁnely tuned grass-endophyte associations are, and how interfering with the signaling pathways involved in maintenance of these associations can trigger a change from mutualistic to pathogenic interaction.",1,What triggers grass endophytes to switch from mutualism to pathogenism?,
"Endophytes typically coexist with plants in symbiosis and transition into the saprobic system as plant tissues senesce, participating in the decomposition process of litter. However, the dynamic changes of endophytic communities during this process and their role in litter decomposition remain unclear. This study tracked the microbial composition across the transition from live leaves to litter in Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl (C. camphora) , evaluating the contribution of endophytes to litter decomposition by examining microbial diversity, community assembly, and co-occurrence networks along the endophyte-to-saprotroph spectrum. The results revealed increasing bacterial diversity but stable fungal diversity, and the diversity of endogenous microbes is mirrored this in the saprophytic phase. Bacterial community assembly was characterized by deterministic processes during the symbiotic phase, shifted to stochastic processes during the saprophytic phase. In contrast, fungal community assembly was predominantly driven by stochastic processes throughout the continuum. Out of the 49 keystone taxa identified, only Pseudorhodoplanes sinuspersici demonstrated a significant positive correlation with community assembly. All identified bacterial keystone taxa during the saprophytic phase originated from endophytic sources, and around 80\% of the fungal keystone taxa in the initial stages of decomposition were similarly endophytic in origin. Additionally, 60\% of the dominant bacterial taxa and 28\% of the dominant fungal taxa at the commencement of decomposition were of endophytic descent. This suggests that endogenous microbes possess the potential to evolve into both keystone and dominant taxa during the saprophytic phase. Endogenous keystone and dominant microbes both exhibited significant correlations with microbial network, indicating their substantial ecological presence in microbial community. Both endogenous keystone and dominant taxa exerted significant potential influences on litter decomposition. Overall, during the saprophytic phase, endophytes are likely to influence the assemblage of microbial communities, the network structure, and decomposition-related functions. Specifically, it appears that bacterial endophytes may possess a greater adaptability to the decomposition processes of leaf litter compared to their fungal counterparts.",1,Tracing microbial community across endophyte-to-saprotroph continuum of {Cinnamomum} camphora ({L}.) {Presl} leaves considering priority effect of endophyte on litter decomposition,
"Tricholoma matsutake is an economically important ectomycorrhizal fungus of coniferous woodlands. Mycologists suspect that this fungus is also capable of saprotrophic feeding. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, enzyme and chemical assays were performed in the field and laboratory. From a natural population of T. matsutake in southern Finland, samples of soil–mycelium aggregate (shiro) were taken from sites of sporocarp formation and nearby control (PCR-negative) spots. Soil organic carbon and activity rates of hemicellulolytic enzymes were measured. The productivity of T. matsutake was related to the amount of utilizable organic carbon in the shiro, where the activity of xylosidase was significantly higher than in the control sample. In the laboratory, sterile pieces of bark from the roots of Scots pine were inoculated with T. matsutake and the activity rates of two hemicellulolytic enzymes (xylosidase and glucuronidase) were assayed. Furthermore, a liquid culture system showed how T. matsutake can utilize hemicellulose as its sole carbon source. Results linked and quantified the general relationship between enzymes secreted by T. matsutake and the degradation of hemicellulose. Our findings suggest that T. matsutake lives mainly as an ectomycorrhizal symbiont but can also feed as a saprotroph. A flexible trophic ecology confers T. matsutake with a clear advantage in a heterogeneous environment and during sporocarp formation.",1,The ectomycorrhizal fungus {Tricholoma} matsutake is a facultative saprotroph in vitro,
"Host jumps by microbial symbionts are often associated with bursts of species diversification driven by the exploitation of new adaptive zones. The objective of this study was to infer the evolution of habitat preference (decaying plants, soil, living fungi, and living plants), and nutrition mode (saprotrophy and mycoparasitism) in the fungal genus Trichoderma to elucidate possible interkingdom host jumps and shifts in ecology. Host and ecological role shifts were inferred by phylogenetic analyses and ancestral character reconstructions. The results support several interkingdom host jumps and also show that the preference for a particular habitat was gained or lost multiple times. Diversification analysis revealed that mycoparasitism is associated with accelerated speciation rates, which then suggests that this trait may be linked to the high number of species in Trichoderma. In this study it was also possible to infer the cryptic roles that endophytes or soil inhabitants play in their hosts by evaluating their closest relatives and determining their most recent ancestors. Findings from this study may have implications for understanding certain evolutionary processes such as species radiations in some hyperdiverse groups of fungi, and for more applied fields such as the discovery and development of novel biological control strategies.",1,{EVOLUTION} {OF} {HABITAT} {PREFERENCE} {AND} {NUTRITION} {MODE} {IN} {A} {COSMOPOLITAN} {FUNGAL} {GENUS} {WITH} {EVIDENCE} {OF} {INTERKINGDOM} {HOST} {JUMPS} {AND} {MAJOR} {SHIFTS} {IN} {ECOLOGY}: {TRICHODERMA} {EVOLUTION},
"Premise of the Study The Hymenochaetales are dominated by lignicolous saprotrophic fungi involved in wood decay. However, the group also includes bryophilous and terricolous taxa, but their modes of nutrition are not clear. Here, we investigate patterns of carbon and nitrogen utilization in numerous non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales and provide a phylogenetic context in which these non‐canonical ecological guilds arose. Methods We combined stable isotope analyses of δ 13 C and δ 15 N and phylogenetic analyses to explore assignment and evolution of nutritional modes. Clustering procedures and statistical tests were performed to assign trophic modes to Hymenochaetales and test for differences between varying ecologies. Genomes of Hymenochaetales were mined for presence of enzymes involved in plant cell wall and lignin degradation and sucrolytic activity. Key Results Three different trophic clusters were detected – biotrophic, saprotrophic, and a second biotrophic cluster including many bryophilous Hymenochaetales and mosses. Non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales are generally biotrophic. All lignicolous Hymenochaetales clustered as saprotrophic and most terricolous Hymenochaetales clustered as ectomycorrhizal. Overall, at least 15 species of Hymenochaetales are inferred as biotrophic. Bryophilous species of Rickenella can degrade plant cell walls and lignin, and cleave sucrose to glucose consistent with a parasitic or endophytic life style. Conclusions Most non‐lignicolous Hymenochaetales are biotrophic. Stable isotope values of many bryophilous Hymenochaetales cluster as ectomycorrhizal or in a biotrophic cluster indicative of parasitism or an endophytic life style. Overall, trophic mode diversity in the Hymenochaetales is greater than anticipated, and non‐lignicolous ecological traits and biotrophic modes of nutrition are evolutionarily derived features.",1,Stable isotope analyses reveal previously unknown trophic mode diversity in the {Hymenochaetales},
"• Lichenization is one of the most important fungal lifestyles and lichen fungi are assumed to form obligate symbioses with their photobionts. Here we test if lichenized and non-lichenized samples in three cases of closely related lichenized Conotrema and saprotrophic Stictis (Stictidaceae, Ostropales, Ascomycota) in northern Scandinavia, form distinct monophyletic groups (= species). • We applied phylogenetic species recognition, by analysing fungal DNA sequence data from four independent genomic markers. • Separate parsimony and parsimony jack-knifing analyses of three independent genes are congruent and result in intermixed groups of lichenized and saprotrophic specimens. The sequence variation in an intron also supports this. Our results suggest that all three cases represent independent fungal phylogenetic species, which can undergo their whole sexual lifecycle either as lichens or as saprotrophs. • The use of different nutritional modes – optional lichenization – allows separate individuals to exploit different niches during the forest succession. We suggest that this environmental plasticity may be common in the Stictidaceae, and propose that it is an overlooked strategy in fungi adapted to unpredictable successional ecosystems.",1,Saprotrophy and lichenization as options for the same fungal species on different substrata: environmental plasticity and fungal lifestyles in the {Stictis–{Conotrema}} complex,
"Fungi play crucial roles in the biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems, most notably as saprophytes decomposing organic matter and as mycorrhizal fungi enhancing plant nutrient uptake. However, a recurrent problem in fungal ecology is to establish the trophic status of species in the field. Our interpretations and conclusions are too often based on extrapolations from laboratory microcosm experiments or on anecdotal field evidence. Here, we used natural variations in stable carbon isotope ratios (δ 13 C) as an approach to distinguish between fungal decomposers and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungal species in the rich sporocarp flora (our sample contains 135 species) of temperate forests. We also demonstrated that host-specific mycorrhizal fungi that receive C from overstorey or understorey tree species differ in their δ 13 C. The many promiscuous mycorrhizal fungi, associated with and connecting several tree hosts, were calculated to receive 57–100\% of their C from overstorey trees. Thus, overstorey trees also support, partly or wholly, the nutrient-absorbing mycelia of their alleged competitors, the understorey trees.",1,Natural$^{\textrm{13}}$ {C} abundance reveals trophic status of fungi and host-origin of carbon in mycorrhizal fungi in mixed forests,
"Summary Some soil fungi in the Leotiomycetes form ericoid mycorrhizal ( ERM ) symbioses with Ericaceae. In the harsh habitats in which they occur, ERM plant survival relies on nutrient mobilization from soil organic matter ( SOM ) by their fungal partners. The characterization of the fungal genetic machinery underpinning both the symbiotic lifestyle and SOM degradation is needed to understand ERM symbiosis functioning and evolution, and its impact on soil carbon (C) turnover. We sequenced the genomes of the ERM fungi Meliniomyces bicolor , M. variabilis , Oidiodendron maius and Rhizoscyphus ericae , and compared their gene repertoires with those of fungi with different lifestyles (ecto‐ and orchid mycorrhiza, endophytes, saprotrophs, pathogens). We also identified fungal transcripts induced in symbiosis. The ERM fungal gene contents for polysaccharide‐degrading enzymes, lipases, proteases and enzymes involved in secondary metabolism are closer to those of saprotrophs and pathogens than to those of ectomycorrhizal symbionts. The fungal genes most highly upregulated in symbiosis are those coding for fungal and plant cell wall‐degrading enzymes ( CWDE s), lipases, proteases, transporters and mycorrhiza‐induced small secreted proteins (Mi SSP s). The ERM fungal gene repertoire reveals a capacity for a dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle. This may reflect an incomplete transition from saprotrophy to the mycorrhizal habit, or a versatile life strategy similar to fungal endophytes. , See also the Commentary on this article by Selosse et al. , 217 : 968–972 .",1,Comparative genomics and transcriptomics depict ericoid mycorrhizal fungi as versatile saprotrophs and plant mutualists,
"Recent sequencing projects have provided deep insight into fungal lifestyle-associated genomic adaptations. Here we report on the 25 Mb genome of the mutualistic root symbiont Piriformospora indica (Sebacinales, Basidiomycota) and provide a global characterization of fungal transcriptional responses associated with the colonization of living and dead barley roots. Extensive comparative analysis of the P. indica genome with other Basidiomycota and Ascomycota fungi that have diverse lifestyle strategies identified features typically associated with both, biotrophism and saprotrophism. The tightly controlled expression of the lifestyle-associated gene sets during the onset of the symbiosis, revealed by microarray analysis, argues for a biphasic root colonization strategy of P. indica. This is supported by a cytological study that shows an early biotrophic growth followed by a cell death-associated phase. About 10\% of the fungal genes induced during the biotrophic colonization encoded putative small secreted proteins (SSP), including several lectin-like proteins and members of a P. indica-specific gene family (DELD) with a conserved novel seven-amino acids motif at the C-terminus. Similar to effectors found in other filamentous organisms, the occurrence of the DELDs correlated with the presence of transposable elements in gene-poor repeat-rich regions of the genome. This is the first in depth genomic study describing a mutualistic symbiont with a biphasic lifestyle.

"Summary Ectomycorrhizal ( ECM ) symbioses have evolved a minimum of 78 times independently from saprotrophic lineages, indicating the potential for functional overlap between ECM and saprotrophic fungi. ECM fungi have the capacity to decompose organic matter, and although there is increasing evidence that some saprotrophic fungi exhibit the capacity to enter into facultative biotrophic relationships with plant roots without causing disease symptoms, this subject is still not well studied. In order to determine the extent of biotrophic capacity in saprotrophic wood‐decay fungi and which systems may be useful models, we investigated the colonization of conifer seedling roots in vitro using an array of 201 basidiomycete wood‐decay fungi. Microtome sectioning, differential staining and fluorescence microscopy were used to visualize patterns of root colonization in microcosm systems containing Picea abies or Pinus sylvestris seedlings and each saprotrophic fungus. Thirty‐four (16.9\%) of the tested fungal species colonized the roots of at least one tree species. Two fungal species showed formation of a mantle and one showed Hartig net‐like structures. These features suggest the possibility of an active functional symbiosis between fungus and plant. The data indicate that the capacity for facultative biotrophic relationships in free‐living saprotrophic basidiomycetes may be greater than previously supposed. , See also the Commentary on this article by Baldrian \& Kohout, 215 : 511–513 .",1,Growing evidence for facultative biotrophy in saprotrophic fungi: data from microcosm tests with 201 species of wood‐decay basidiomycetes,
"Saprophytic, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and pathogenic fungi play a key role in carbon and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Whereas more than 50 genomes of saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi have been published, only two genomes of ECM fungi, Laccaria bicolor and Tuber melanosporum, have been released. Comparative analysis of the genomes of biotrophic species highlighted convergent evolution. Mutualistic and pathogenic biotrophic fungi share expansion of genome size through transposon proliferation and common strategies to avoid plant detection. Differences mainly rely on nutritional strategies. Such analyses also pinpointed how blurred the molecular boundaries are between saprotrophism, symbiosis and pathogenesis. Sequencing of additional ECM species, as well as soil saprotrophic fungi, will facilitate the identification of conserved traits for ECM symbiosis and those leading to the transition from white-rotting and brown-rotting to the ECM lifestyle.",1,Mutualistic interactions on a knife-edge between saprotrophy and pathogenesis,
"Fungal endophytes and saprotrophs generally play an important ecological role within plant tissues and dead plant material. Several reports based solely on morphological observations have postulated that there is an intimate link between endophytes and saprotrophs. This study aims to provide valuable insight as to whether some endophytic fungi manifest themselves as saprotrophs upon host decay. Ribosomal DNA-based sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationships from 99 fungal isolates (endophytes, mycelia sterilia, and saprotrophs) recovered from leaves and twigs of Magnolia liliifera were investigated in this study. Molecular data suggest there are fungal taxa that possibly exist as endophytes and saprotrophs. Isolates of Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Guignardia, and Phomopsis, which are common plant endophytes, have high sequence similarity and are phylogenetically related to their saprotrophic counterparts. This provides evidence to suggest that some endophytic species change their ecological strategies and adopt a saprotrophic lifestyle. The implication of these findings on fungal biodiversity and host specificity is also discussed.",1,A {Phylogenetic} {Evaluation} of {Whether} {Endophytes} {Become} {Saprotrophs} at {Host} {Senescence},
"Summary Nonphotosynthetic mycorrhizal plants have long attracted the curiosity of botanists and mycologists, and they have been a target for unabated controversy and speculation. In fact, these puzzling plants dominated the very beginnings of the field of mycorrhizal biology.

Here I explore our knowledge of these evolutionarily and ecologically diverse plant–fungal symbioses, highlighting areas where there has been significant progress.

"What traits make plant rooting strategies adaptive for shallow or deep soils in water-limited environments? One is tempted to answer that effective shallow root systems should be best for shallow soils, while deep rooting would be best for deep soils. This is not what was found in a recent study by Poot \& Lambers (this issue; pp. 371–381), who compared root developments and root system morphologies of two rare Hakea species (Proteaceae), which were endemic to shallow soils over ironstone, with four Hakea species commonly found on deeper soils in the same region of southwestern Australia.

"This review examines the symbiotic, evolutionary, proteomic and genetic basis for a group of fungi that occupy a specialized niche as insect pathogens as well as endophytes. We focus primarily on species in the genera Metarhizium and Beauveria, traditionally recognized as insect pathogenic fungi but are also found as plant symbionts. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these fungi are more closely related to grass endophytes and diverged from that lineage ca. 100 MYA. We explore how the dual life cycles of these fungi as insect pathogens and endophytes are coupled. We discuss the evolution of insect pathogenesis while maintaining an endophytic lifestyle and provide examples of genes that may be involved in the transition toward insect pathogenicity. That is, some genes for insect pathogenesis may have been co-opted from genes involved in endophytic colonization. Other genes may be multifunctional and serve in both lifestyle capacities. We suggest that their evolution as insect pathogens allowed them to effectively barter a specialized nitrogen source (i.e. insects) with host plants for photosynthate. These ubiquitous fungi may play an important role as plant growth promoters and have a potential reservoir of secondary metabolites.",1,Fungi with multifunctional lifestyles: endophytic insect pathogenic fungi,
"The frequency of infection, lesion characteristics and anatomical changes in phloem and cambial tissues caused by Armillaria sinapina were studied on inoculated trees of Douglas-ﬁr, western hemlock and western redcedar and compared with results of A. ostoyae inoculations previously reported on the same host species. Similar percentages of inoculations resulting in infection of roots on the three hosts indicate that A. sinapina and A. ostoyae are equally pathogenic. Armillaria ostoyae was more virulent than A. sinapina as demonstrated by fungal exudates from A. ostoyae inoculum blocks, which appeared to cause lesions on roots; the higher frequency at which ligniﬁed impervious tissue (IT) and necrophylactic periderm (NP) developed in bark and following cambial invasion, compartmentalization; the large proportion of roots that showed no visible host response; the large zones of IT formed under continuous stimulation by A. ostoyae advancing in inner bark; and the high frequency of breaching of NP barriers. Spread of A. sinapina mycelium in host species appeared slower than that of A. ostoyae, particularly in Douglas-ﬁr and western hemlock. In western redcedar, A. ostoyae induced stronger host responses than those following invasion by A. sinapina, which included further expansion of the induced rhytidome response, traumatic phloem resin duct formation and higher numbers of polyphenolic parenchyma comprising its barrier zone. Where damage by A. sinapina ensued, it was always associated with high inoculum potential.

"Arbutoid mycorrhizal plants are commonly found as understory vegetation in forests worldwide where ectomycorrhiza-forming trees occur. Comarostaphylis arbutoides (Ericaceae) is a tropical woody plant and common in tropical Central America. This plant forms arbutoid mycorrhiza, whereas only associations with Leccinum monticola as well as Sebacina sp. are described so far. We collected arbutoid mycorrhizas of C. arbutoides from the Cerro de la Muerte (Cordillera de Talamanca), Costa Rica, where this plant species grows together with Quercus costaricensis. We provide here the first evidence of mycorrhizal status for the Ascomycete Leotia cf. lubrica (Helotiales) that was so far under discussion as saprophyte or mycorrhizal. This fungus formed arbutoid mycorrhiza with C. arbutoides. The morphotype was described morphologically and anatomically. Leotia cf. lubrica was identified using molecular methods, such as sequencing the internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) and the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA regions, as well as phylogenetic analyses.

"This work presents the first anatomical description of the mycorrhizal systems of Helianthemum almeriense, and of the structure and ultrastructure of the mycorrhizae formed by this plant species with the ascomycetes Terfezia claveryi and Picoa lefebvrei. Four different mycorrhizal systems are described, the clubshaped mycorrhiza being the most abundant. The type of mycorrhiza formed depended on the mycorrhiza culture conditions, but not on the fungal species. For both fungal species, H. almeriense formed an endomycorrhiza in natural field conditions, an ecto- and ectendomycorrhiza without a sheath in pot cultures, and an ectomycorrhiza with a characteristic sheath and Hartig net in in vitro cultures. This is the first report of a typical sheath in Helianthemum-desert truffle mycorrhizal associations. The results support the idea that culture conditions can induce changes in mycorrhiza morphology and that there is no clear barrier between the two main types of mycorrhiza organization in Helianthemum species. The ultrastructural study confirmed the regular presence of T. claveryi intracellular hyphae in direct contact with the host wall, a localization which seems to be a characteristic of the T. claveryi mycorrhiza organization. The P. lefebvrei mycorrhiza organization was characterized by intracellular hyphae with large amounts of electron-dense globules, probably with a lipidic content, and a warty ornamentation on the wall of the root external hyphae.",0,Morphological characterization of the mycorrhiza formed by {Helianthemum} almeriense {Pau} with {Terfezia} claveryi {Chatin} and {Picoa} lefebvrei ({Pat}.) {Maire},
"Ectomycorrhizal fungi are crucial for forests sustainability. For Castanea sativa, ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius is an important mutualist partner. Saprotrophic fungi Hypholoma fasciculare, although used for biocontrol of Armillaria root disease, it negatively affected the interaction between the P. tinctorius and plant host roots, by compromise the formation of P. tinctorius-C. sativa mycorrhizae. In this work, fungal morphology during inhibition of H. fasciculare against P. tinctorius was elucidated. P. tinctorius growth was strongly affected by H. fasciculare, which was significantly reduced after six days of co-culture and become even more significant through time. During this period, P. tinctorius developed vesicles and calcium oxalate crystals, which were described as mechanisms to stress adaption by fungi. H. fasciculare produced different volatile organic compounds in co-cultures over time and differ between single or in dualspecies. H. fasciculare highly produced sesquiterpenes (namely, α-muurolene) and nitrogencontaining compounds, which are recognised as having antimicrobial activity.",0,{In vitro} interactions between the ectomycorrhizal {Pisolithus tinctorius} and the saprotroph {Hypholoma fasciculare} fungi: morphological aspects and volatile production,
"Activities of carboxylation enzymes were analyzed in the mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria (L. ex Fr.) Hooker, in non‐mycorrhizal short roots of Norway spruce ( Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and in myconhizas of these two partners. While pyruvale carboxylase (PC, EC 6.4.1.1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities (PEPCK.EC 4.1.1.49) could be detected in the mycelium of A. muscaria , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyknase (PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31) was only active in root tissue. In A. muscaria , PC activity was generally low (around 10 nmol mg −t protein min − ) but PEPCK activity was above 250 nmol mg −1 protein min −1 . Mycorrhizal development on short roots decreased PEPC activity by more than 75\%, although dilution by the fungal biomass in mycorrhizas was only 35\%. This reduction in activity was paralleled by a decreased content of PEPC protein. By means of micro‐analytical methods it was shown that PEPC activity was lowest in the central zones of the mycorrhizas, Whereas PEPC activity was highest in the corresponding central sections in non‐mycorrhizal short roots. 14 CO 2 labelling, on the other hand, revealed that in vivo CO 2 fixation was higher in mycorrhizas compared to non‐mycorrhizal short roots. It is concluded that fungal carboxylases (probably PEPCK) are important for anaplerotic CO 2 fixation during nitrogen assimilation in mycorrhizas of Norway spruce.",0,Mycorrhiza formation on {Norway} spruce ( {Picea abies} ) roots affects the pathway of anaplerotic {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ fixation,

The new genus is characterized by minute, hyaline or subhyaline to pale brown perithecia immersed in the substratum with hyaline to subhyaline emergent necks. Paraphyses disintegrate with age, asci are cylindrical-clavate with a distinct apical annulus containing eight hyaline ascospores; ascospores are smooth-walled, ranging from ellipsoidal to fusiform to cylindrical-fusiform, without a mucilaginous sheath or appendages.

However, the generic boundaries in Stachybotriaceae are still poorly defined, as type material and sequence data are not readily available for taxonomic studies. To address this issue, we performed multi-locus phylogenetic analyses using partial gene sequences of the 28S large subunit (LSU), the internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nrRNA (ITS), the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit ( rpb2 ), calmodulin ( cmdA ), translation elongation factor 1-alpha ( tef1 ) and β-tubulin ( tub2 ) for all available type and authentic strains.

"Abstract Microorganisms play a crucial role in the biological decomposition of plant litter in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the permanently changing litter quality during decomposition, studies of both fungi and bacteria at a fine taxonomic resolution are required during the whole process. Here we investigated microbial community succession in decomposing leaf litter of temperate beech forest using pyrotag sequencing of the bacterial 16S and the fungal internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) rRNA genes. Our results reveal that both communities underwent rapid changes. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated over the entire study period, but their taxonomic composition and abundances changed markedly among sampling dates. The fungal community also changed dynamically as decomposition progressed, with ascomycete fungi being increasingly replaced by basidiomycetes. We found a consistent and highly significant correlation between bacterial richness and fungal richness ( R = 0.76, P {<} 0.001) and community structure ( R M antel = 0.85, P {<} 0.001), providing evidence of coupled dynamics in the fungal and bacterial communities. A network analysis highlighted nonrandom co‐occurrences among bacterial and fungal taxa as well as a shift in the cross‐kingdom co‐occurrence pattern of their communities from the early to the later stages of decomposition. During this process, macronutrients, micronutrients, C:N ratio and pH were significantly correlated with the fungal and bacterial communities, while bacterial richness positively correlated with three hydrolytic enzymes important for C, N and P acquisition. Overall, we provide evidence that the complex litter decay is the result of a dynamic cross‐kingdom functional succession.",0,Life in leaf litter: novel insights into community dynamics of bacteria and fungi during litter decomposition,

"ABSTRACT Cladobotryum dendroides (= Dactylium dendroides ) has hitherto been regarded as the major causal agent of cobweb disease of the cultivated mushroom, Agaricus bisporus . Nucleotide sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of four Cladobotryum/Hypomyces species reported to be associated with cobweb disease, however, indicate that the most common pathogen is now C. mycophilum . This cobweb pathogen varies somewhat in conidial septation from published descriptions of C. mycophilum and lacks the distinctive colony odor. ITS sequencing revealed minor nucleotide variation which split isolates of the pathogen into three subgroups, two comprising isolates that were sensitive to methylbenzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides and one comprising MBC-resistant isolates. The MBC-resistant isolates, which were only obtained from Ireland and Great Britain, clustered together strongly in randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis, suggesting that they may be clonal. The MBC-sensitive isolates were more diverse. A RAPD fragment of 800 to 900 bp, containing a microsatellite and found in the MBC-resistant isolates, also indicated their clonal nature; the microsatellites of these isolates contained the same number of GA repeats.

"Septoria represents a genus of plant pathogenic fungi with a wide geographic distribution, commonly associated with leaf spots and stem cankers of a broad range of plant hosts. A major aim of this study was to resolve the phylogenetic generic limits of Septoria, Stagonospora, and other related genera such as Sphaerulina, Phaeosphaeria and Phaeoseptoria using sequences of the the partial 28S nuclear ribosomal RNA and RPB2 genes of a large set of isolates. Based on these results Septoria is shown to be a distinct genus in the Mycosphaerellaceae, which has mycosphaerella-like sexual morphs. Several septoria-like species are now accommodated in Sphaerulina, a genus previously linked to this complex. Phaeosphaeria (based on P. oryzae) is shown to be congeneric with Phaeoseptoria (based on P. papayae), which is reduced to synonymy under the former. Depazea nodorum (causal agent of nodorum blotch of cereals) and Septoria avenae (causal agent of avenae blotch of barley and rye) are placed in a new genus, Parastagonospora, which is shown to be distinct from Stagonospora (based on S. paludosa) and Phaeosphaeria. Partial nucleotide sequence data for five gene loci, ITS, LSU, EF-1α, RPB2 and Btub were generated for all of these isolates.

"Dollar spot is one of the most destructive and economically important fungal diseases of amenity turfgrasses. The causal agent was first described in 1937 as the ascomycete Sclerotinia homoeocarpa. However, the genus-level taxonomic placement of this fungus has been the subject of an ongoing debate for over 75 y. Existing morphological and rDNA sequence evidence indicates that this organism is more appropriately placed in the family Rutstroemiaceae rather than the Sclerotiniaceae. Here we use DNA sequence data from samples of the dollar spot fungus and other members of the Rutstroemiaceae (e.g. Rutstroemia, Lanzia, Lambertella) collected throughout the world to determine the generic identity of the turfgrass dollar spot pathogen. Phylogenetic evidence from three nucleotide sequence markers (CaM, ITS and Mcm7; 1810-bp) confirmed that S. homoeocarpa is not a species of Sclerotinia; nor is it a member of any known genus in the Rutstroemiaceae. These data support the establishment of a new genus, which we describe here as Clarireedia gen. nov. The type species for the genus, Clarireedia homoeocarpa comb. nov., is described to accommodate the dollar spot fungus, and a neotype is designated. Three new species in this clade, Clarireedia bennettii sp. nov., Clarireedia jacksonii sp. nov., and Clarireedia monteithiana sp. nov. that also cause dollar spot disease are described. Clarireedia homoeocarpa and C. bennettii occur primarily on Festuca rubra (C3 grass) hosts and appear to be restricted to the United Kingdom. Clarireedia jacksonii and C. monteithiana occur on a variety of C3 and C4 grass hosts, respectively, and appear to be globally distributed. This resolved taxonomy puts to rest a major controversy amongst plant pathologists and provides a foundation for better understanding the nature and biology of these destructive pathogens.",0,Clarireedia: {A} new fungal genus comprising four pathogenic species responsible for dollar spot disease of turfgrass,
"Species of the genus Coniochaeta (anamorph: Lecythophora ) are known as pathogens of woody hosts, but can also cause opportunistic human infections. Several fungi with conidial stages resembling Lecythophora were isolated from necrotic wood samples of Prunus trees in South Africa. In order to reveal their phylogenetic relationships, these fungi were studied on a morphological and molecular (5.8S nrDNA, ITS-1, ITS-2, GAPDH, EF-1α, 28S nrDNA, 18S nrDNA) basis. Some of the isolates were identified as Coniochaeta ( Sordariomycetes ), including C. velutina and two new species, C. africana and C. prunicola . The majority of the isolates, however, formed pycnidial or pseudopycnidial synanamorphs and were not closely related to Coniochaeta. According to their 28S nrDNA phylogeny, they formed two distinct groups, one of which was closely related to Helotiales ( Leotiomycetes ). The new genus Collophora is proposed, comprising five species that frequently occur in necrotic peach and nectarine wood, namely Co. africana , Co. capensis , Co. paarla , Co. pallida and Co. rubra . The second group was closely related to Phaeomoniella chlamydospora ( Eurotiomycetes ), occurring mainly in plum wood. Besides P. zymoides occurring on Prunus salicina , four new species are described, namely P. dura , P. effusa , P. prunicola and P. tardicola . In a preliminary inoculation study, pathogenicity was confirmed for some of the new species on apricot, peach or plum wood.",0,"{Coniochaeta} ( {Lecythophora} ), {Collophora} gen. nov. and {Phaeomoniella} species associated with wood necroses of {Prunus} trees",
"A survey of fungal pathogens of Miconia calvescens was carried out in Brazil aimed at finding potential classical biocontrol agents for management of this invasive alien weed in Hawaii. Coccodiella miconiae, Glomerella cingulata ( = Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. miconiae) and the new species Guignardia miconiae and Korunomyces prostratus were found associated with foliar diseases and are described herein. Two previously undescribed spore stages of Coccodiella miconiae also were obtained allowing a complete description of this species. Pseudocercospora tamonae associated with leaf spots of other species of Miconia also was collected and also was proven to be pathogenic to M. calvescens.",0,"Fungal pathogens of {Miconia calvescens} ({Melastomataceae}) from {Brazil}, with reference to classical biological control",
"Although Nectria is the type genus of Nectriaceae (Hypocreales, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota), the systematics of the teleomorphic and anamorphic state of Nectria sensu Rossman has not been studied in detail. The objectives of this study are to 1) provide a phylogenetic overview to determine if species of Nectria with Gyrostroma, Tubercularia, and Zythiostroma anamorphs form a monophyletic group; 2) define Nectria, segregate genera, and their species using morphologically informative characters of teleomorphic and anamorphic states; and 3) provide descriptions and illustrations of these genera and species. To accomplish these objectives, results of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from six loci (act, ITS, LSU, rpb1, tef1 and tub), were integrated with morphological characterisations of anamorphs and teleomorphs. Results from the phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that species previously regarded as the genus Nectria having Gyrostroma, Tubercularia, and Zythiostroma anamorphs belong in two major paraphyletic clades. The first major clade regarded as the genus Pleonectria contains 26 species with ascoconidia produced by ascospores in asci, perithecial walls having bright yellow scurf, and immersed or superficial pycnidial anamorphs (Zythiostroma = Gyrostroma). A lineage basal to the Pleonectria clade includes Nectria miltina having very small, aseptate ascospores, and trichoderma-like conidiophores and occurring on monocotyledonous plants. These characteristics are unusual in Pleonectria, thus we recognise the monotypic genus Allantonectria with Allantonectria miltina. The second major clade comprises the genus Nectria sensu stricto including the type species, N. cinnabarina, and 28 additional species. Within the genus Nectria, four subclades exist. One subclade includes species with sporodochial anamorphs and another with synnematous anamorphs. The other two paraphyletic subclades include species that produce abundant stromata in which the large perithecia are immersed, large ascospores, and peculiar anamorphs that form pycnidia or sporodochia either on their natural substrate or in culture. In this study the evolution of species, morphology, and ecology of the three genera, Allantonectria, Nectria, and Pleonectria, are discussed based on the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, descriptions, illustrations, and keys for identification are presented for the 56 species in Allantonectria, Nectria, and Pleonectria.",0,"A monograph of {Allantonectria}, {Nectria}, and {Pleonectria} ({Nectriaceae}, {Hypocreales}, {Ascomycota}) and their pycnidial, sporodochial, and synnematous anamorphs",
"Two new pathogens of pyrethrum, described as Paraphoma chlamydocopiosa and Paraphoma pye , isolated from necrotic leaf lesions on pyrethrum plants in northern Tasmania, Australia, were identified using morphological characters, phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ), elongation factor 1‐α ( EF 1 ‐α) and β‐tubulin ( TUB ) genes, and pathogenicity bioassays. Bootstrap support in the combined and individual gene region phylogenetic trees supported the two species that were significantly different from the closely related P. chrysanthemicola and P. vinacea . Morphological characteristics also supported the two new species, with conidia of P. chlamydocopiosa being considerably longer and wider than either P. chrysanthemicola or P. vinacea , and P. pye being distinct in forming bilocular pycnidia. Glasshouse pathogenicity tests based on root dip inoculation resulted in P. chlamydocopiosa and P. pye infecting the crown and upper root tissues of pyrethrum plants, and significant reduction in biomass 2 months after inoculation. Both of these Paraphoma species caused leaf lesions during in vitro and in vivo bioassays 2 weeks after foliar spray inoculation. Although P. chlamydocopiosa and P. pye were shown to be crown rot pathogens, they were also commonly isolated from leaves of diseased plants in pyrethrum fields of northern Tasmania.",0,"{Paraphoma chlamydocopiosa} sp. nov. and {Paraphoma pye} sp. nov., two new species associated with leaf and crown infection of pyrethrum",
"Abstract Experimental tests of community assembly mechanisms for host‐associated microbiomes in nature are lacking. Asymptomatic foliar fungal endophytes are a major component of the plant microbiome and are increasingly recognized for their impacts on plant performance, including pathogen defense, hormonal manipulation, and drought tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether fungal endophytes preferentially colonize certain host ecotypes or genotypes, reflecting some degree of biotic adaptation in the symbioses, or whether colonization is simply a function of spore type and abundance within the local environment. Whether host ecotype, local environment, or some combination of both controls the pattern of microbiome formation across hosts represents a new dimension to the age‐old debate of nature versus nurture. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant design to explore the extent of host specificity and biotic adaptation in the plant microbiome, as evidenced by differential colonization of host genetic types by endophytes. Specifically, replicate plants from three locally‐adapted ecotypes of the native grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were transplanted at three geographically distinct field sites (one home and two away) in the Midwestern US . At the end of the growing season, plant leaves were harvested and the fungal microbiome characterized using culture‐dependent sequencing techniques. Our results demonstrated that fungal endophyte community structure was determined by local environment (i.e., site), but not by host ecotype. Fungal richness and diversity also strongly differed by site, with lower fungal diversity at a riparian field site, whereas host ecotype had no effect. By contrast, there were significant differences in plant phenotypes across all ecotypes and sites, indicating ecotypic differentiation of host phenotype. Overall, our results indicate that environmental factors are the primary drivers of community structure in the switchgrass fungal microbiome.",0,Foliar fungal endophyte communities are structured by environment but not host ecotype in {Panicum virgatum} (switchgrass),
"Microbial symbionts inhabit tissues of all plants and animals. Their community composition depends largely on two ecological processes: (1) filtering by abiotic conditions and host species determining the environments that symbionts are able to colonize and (2) dispersal-limitation determining the pool of symbionts available to colonize a given host and community spatial structure. In plants, the above- and belowground tissues represent such distinct habitats for symbionts that we expect different effects of filtering and spatial structuring on their symbiont communities. In this study, we characterized above- and belowground communities of fungal endophytes—fungi living asymptomatically within plants—to understand the contributions of filtering and spatial structure to endophyte community composition. We used a culture-based approach to characterize endophytes growing in leaves and roots of three species of coastal beachgrasses in dunes of the USA Pacific Northwest. For leaves, endophyte isolation frequency and OTU richness depended primarily on plant host species. In comparison, for roots, both isolation frequency and OTU richness increased from the nutrient-poor front of the dune to the higher-nutrient backdune. Endophyte community composition in leaves exhibited a distance-decay relationship across the region. In a laboratory assay, faster growth rates and lower spore production were more often associated with leaf- than root-inhabiting endophytes. Overall, our results reveal a greater importance of biotic filtering by host species and dispersal-limitation over regional geographic distances for aboveground leaf endophyte communities and stronger effects of abiotic environmental filtering and locally patchy distributions for belowground root endophyte communities.",0,"Plant {Host} {Species} and {Geographic} {Distance} {Affect} the {Structure} of {Aboveground} {Fungal} {Symbiont} {Communities}, and {Environmental} {Filtering} {Affects} {Belowground} {Communities} in a {Coastal} {Dune} {Ecosystem}",
"A new genus, Acidomelania, is described based on molecular phylogenetic analyses and ecological and morphological characters. Isolated from switchgrass roots in acidic and oligotrophic New Jersey pine barrens in this study, Acidomelania likely has a global distribution because its internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence has high similarity with a number of GenBank sequences resulted from various ecological studies. Apparently these samples all were from roots of plants that lived in acidic, nutrient-poor environments. Phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, LSU and ACT sequence data strongly supported the fact that Acidomelania isolates formed a monophyletic clade in Helotiales, distinct from any known taxa. Phylogenetically Acidomelania is closely related to Loramyces, Mollisia and Phialocephala fortinii, Acephala applanata species complex (PAC), the dark septate endophytes. Acidomelania also can be distinguished from Loramyces and Mollisia by its association with living grass roots. While taxa in PAC also are root endophytes, they have more complex phialid arrangement than Acidomelania. Results from this work will facilitate ecological and evolutionary studies on root-associated fungi.",0,{Acidomelania panicicola} gen. et sp. nov. from switchgrass roots in acidic {New} {Jersey} pine barrens,
"Abstract The family Tricholomataceae, contained within the Tricholomatoid clade, has traditionally been one of the largest families of the Agaricales. However, in this sense it is highly polyphyletic and requires emendation. Here, we present a phylogeny of the Tricholomatoid clade based on nucleotide sequence data from two nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (large subunit and small subunit) and the second‐largest subunit of RNA polymerase II ( rpb2 ). Our aim is to delimit the Tricholomataceae and identify monophyletic groups within the Tricholomatoid clade. We also infer a separate phylogeny, based on the three genes above, in addition to sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), in order to evaluate generic‐level boundaries within the Tricholomataceae s.str. Based on this analysis we recover seven monophyletic genera within the Tricholomataceae s.str. that correspond to Leucopaxillus, Tricholoma, Pseudotricholoma stat. nov., Porpolomas .str., Dennisiomyces, Corneriella gen. nov., and Albomagister gen. nov. Of the 98 genera that have been traditionally assigned to the Tricholomataceae sensu Singer, only four can be placed within it ( Tricholoma, Porpoloma, Dennisiomyces, Leucopaxillus ). The genus Porpoloma is highly polyphyletic and divided into four genera: Porpoloma s.str., Corneriella gen. nov., Pseudotricholoma stat. nov., and Pogonoloma stat. nov. In all, four new genera are proposed. Taxonomic descriptions, and a key to genera of the Tricholomat‐ aceae as emended here are also presented.",0,"Deconstructing the {Tricholomataceae} ({Agaricales}) and introduction of the new genera {Albomagister} , {Corneriella} , {Pogonoloma} and {Pseudotricholoma}",
